				<p>Enya's captivating compilation album, <strong><em>Paint the Sky with Stars</em></strong>, takes listeners on a nostalgic journey through her illustrious career. Spanning from her <a href="enya-album.html">self-titled debut album</a> in 1987 to the enchanting melodies of <a href="the-memory-of-trees.html"><em>The
					Memory of Trees</em></a> in 1995, this carefully curated collection showcases Enya's most beloved and iconic works. Intertwined within this treasure trove of musical gems are two new tracks that grace the compilation: the titular <a href="#Paint_the_Sky_with_Stars">"Paint the
						Sky with Stars"</a> and the beautiful <a href="#Only_If...">"Only If..."</a>.</p>

				<p>Released on November 3, 1997, under the esteemed label WEA, <em>Paint the Sky with Stars</em> emerged as a testament to Enya's artistic growth and unwavering commitment to her craft. Following her widely acclaimed promotional tour for <em>The Memory of Trees,</em> Enya seized the opportunity afforded by her recording contract with Reprise Records to assemble this remarkable compilation. Critics lauded <em>Paint the Sky with Stars</em> applauding its comprehensive selection of tracks, and the album swiftly ascended the charts, reaching an impressive number four position in the United Kingdom and securing the 30th spot on the esteemed Billboard 200 in the United States.</p>
				
				<p>In the US, the album continued to sell over the next eight years, reaching four million copies shipped in 2005. In Japan, it became the first non-Japanese album under the Warner label to receive a Japan Gold Disc Award in the Grand Prix Album category for selling over one million copies. To promote the compilation album, Enya made several interviews and televised performances.</p>

				<br />
				
				<br />Let me sail, let me sail, let the orinoco flow,
				
				<br />Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli.
				
				<br />Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore,
				
				<br />Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />CHORUS:
				
				<br />Sail away, sail away, sail away...
				
				<br />Sail away, sail away, sail away...
				
				<br />Sail away, sail away, sail away...
				
				<br />Sail away, sail away, sail away...
				
				<br />
				
				<br />From Bissau to Palau - in the shade of Avalon,
				
				<br />From Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony,
				
				<br />From Peru to Cebu hear the power of Babylon,
				
				<br />From Bali to Cali - far beneath the Coral Sea.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up, adieu...
				
				<br />Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up, adieu...
				
				<br />Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up, adieu...
				
				<br />
				
				<br />CHORUS
				
				<br />
				
				<br />From the North to the South, Ebud&aelig; into Khartoum,<br />From the deep sea of Clouds to the island of the moon,
				
				<br />Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been,
				
				<br />Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />We can sail, we can sail, with the Orinoco flow
				
				<br />We can sail, we can sail...
				
				<br />Sail away, sail away, sail away...
				
				<br />
				
				<br />We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel,
				
				<br />We can sigh, say goodbye Ross and his dependencies
				
				<br />We can sail, we can sail...
				
				<br />Sail away, sail away, sail away...
				
				<br />
				
				<br />We can reach, we can beach on the shores of Tripoli,
				
				<br />We can sail, we can sail...
				
				<br />Sail away, sail away, sail away...
				
				<br />
				
				<br />from Bali to Cali - far beneath the Coral Sea,
				
				<br />we can sail, we can sail...
				
				<br />sail away, sail away, sail away...

				<br />One day, one night, one moment,

				<br />One step, one fall, one falter,
				
				<br />east or west, over earth or by ocean.
				
				<br />One way to be my journey,

				<br />I'll flag, I'll fall, I'll falter,

				<br />Far and Away.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />One day, one night, one moment,
				
				<br />with a dream to believe in.
				
				<br />One step, one fall, one falter,
				
				<br />and a new earth across a wide ocean.
				
				<br />This way became my journey,
				
				<br />this day ends together, Far and Away.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />This day ends together, Far and Away.

				<h4><a name="Anywhere_Is"></a>Anywhere Is lyrics</h4>
				
				<em>Roma Ryan</em>
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I walk the maze of moments
				
				<br />but everywhere I turn to
				
				<br />begins a new beginning
				
				<br />but never finds a finish
				
				<br />I walk to the horizon
				
				<br />and there I find another
				
				<br />it all seems so surprising
				
				<br />and then I find that I know
				
				<br />
				
				<br />CHORUS:
				
				<br />You go there you're gone forever
				
				<br />I go there I'll lose my way
				
				<br />if we stay here we're not together
				
				<br />Anywhere is
				
				<br />
				
				<br />The moon upon the ocean
				
				<br />is swept around in motion
				
				<br />but without ever knowing
				
				<br />the reason for its flowing
				
				<br />in motion on the ocean
				
				<br />the moon still keeps on moving
				
				<br />the waves still keep on waving
				
				<br />and I still keep on going
				
				<br />
				
				<br />CHORUS
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I wonder if the stars sign
				
				<br />the life that is to be mine
				
				<br />and would they let their light shine
				
				<br />enough for me to follow
				
				<br />I look up to the heavens
				
				<br />but night has clouded over
				
				<br />no spark of constellation
				
				<br />no Vela no Orion
				
				<br />
				
				<br />The shells upon the warm sands
				
				<br />have taken from their own lands
				
				<br />the echo of their story
				
				<br />but all I hear are low sounds
				
				<br />as pillow words are weaving
				
				<br />and willow waves are leaving
				
				<br />but should I be believing
				
				<br />that I am only dreaming
				
				<br />
				
				<br />CHORUS
				
				<br />
				
				<br />To leave the thread of all time
				
				<br />and let it make a dark line
				
				<br />in hopes that I can still find
				
				<br />the way back to the moment
				
				<br />I took the turn and turned to
				
				<br />begin a new beginning
				
				<br />still looking for the answer
				
				<br />I cannot find the finish
				
				<br />It's either this or that way
				
				<br />it's one way or the other
				
				<br />it should be one direction
				
				<br />it could be on reflection
				
				<br />the turn I have just taken
				
				<br />the turn that I was making
				
				<br />I might be just beginning
				
				<br />I might be near the end.

				<br />
				
				<br />When there's a shadow, you follow the sun.
				
				<br />When there is love, then you look for the one.
				
				<br />And for the promises, there is the sky.
				
				<br />And for the heavens are those who can fly.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />CHORUS:
				
				<br />If you really want to, you can hear me say
				
				<br />Only if you want to will you find a way.
				
				<br />If you really want to you can seize the day.
				
				<br />Only if you want to will you fly away.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Da da da da, da da da da da.
				
				<br />da da da da, da da da da da,
				
				<br />da da da da.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />When there's a journey, you follow a star.
				
				<br />When there's an ocean, you sail from afar.
				
				<br />And for the broken heart, there is the sky.
				
				<br />And for tomorrow are those who can fly.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />CHORUS
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Da da da da, da da da da da.
				
				<br />da da da da, da da da da da,
				
				<br />da da da da.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Ooh go doe bay mwa.
				
				<br />Ooh go doe bay mwa.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Chorus
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Ah! Je voudrai voler comme un oiseau d'aile
				
				<br />Ah! Je voudrai voler comme un oiseau d'aile, d'aile...
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Ooh go doe bay mwa.
				
				<br />Ooh go doe bay mwa.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Chorus
				
				<br />
				
				<br />If you really want to you can seize the day.
				
				<br />Only if you want to will you fly away.
				
				<br />
				
				<br /><strong><em>Notes</em></strong>
				
				<br />"Je voudrai voler comme un oiseau d'aile, d'aile..." in French means "I wish I could fly like a winged, winged bird..."
				
				<br />  
				"Ooh go doe bay mwa" meaning: this huming is not from a known language, but it sounds a bit like "Abandonez moi", French for "Leave me".

				<em>Roma Ryan</em>
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Who can tell me if we have heaven,
				
				<br />who can say the way it should be;
				
				<br />Moonlight holly, the Sappho Comet,
				
				<br />Angel's tears below a tree.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />You talk of the break of morning
				
				<br />as you view the new aurora,
				
				<br />Cloud in crimson, the key of heaven,
				
				<br />one love carved in acajou.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />One told me of China Roses,
				
				<br />One a Thousand nights and one night,
				
				<br />Earth's last picture, the end of evening:
				
				<br />hue of indigo and blue.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />A new moon leads me to
				
				<br />woods of dreams and I follow.
				
				<br />A new world waits for me;
				
				<br />my dream, my way.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I know that if I have heaven
				
				<br />there is nothing to desire.
				
				<br />Rain and river, a world of wonder
				
				<br />may be paradise to me.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I see the sun.
				
				<br />I see the stars.

				<h4><a name="Paint_the_Sky_with_Stars"></a>Paint the Sky with Stars lyrics</h4>
				
				<em>Roma Ryan</em>
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Suddenly before my eyes
				
				<br />Hues of indigo arise
				
				<br />With them how my spirit sighs
				
				<br />Paint the sky with stars
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Only night will ever know
				
				<br />Why the heavens never show
				
				<br />All the dreams there are to know
				
				<br />Paint the sky with stars
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Who has paced the midnight sky?
				
				<br />So a spirit has to fly
				
				<br />As the heavens seem so far
				
				<br />Now who will paint the midnight star?
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Night has brought to those who sleep
				
				<br />Only dreams they cannot keep
				
				<br />I have legends in the deep
				
				<br />Paint the sky with stars
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Who has paced the midnight sky?
				
				<br />So a spirit has to fly
				
				<br />As the heavens seem so far
				
				<br />Now who will paint the midnight star?
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Place a name upon the night
				
				<br />One to set your heart alight
				
				<br />And to make the darkness bright
				
				<br />Paint the sky with stars.

				<h4><a name="Marble_Halls"></a>Marble Halls lyrics</h4>
				
				<em>Alfred Bunn</em>
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
				
				<br />with vassals and serfs at my side,
				
				<br />and of all who assembled within those walls
				
				<br />that I was the hope and the pride.
				
				<br />I had riches all too great to count
				
				<br />and a high ancestral name.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />But I also dreamt which pleased me most
				
				<br />that you loved me still the same,
				
				<br />that you loved me
				
				<br />you loved me still the same,
				
				<br />that you loved me
				
				<br />you loved me still the same.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,
				
				<br />that knights upon bended knee
				
				<br />and with vows no maidens heart could withstand,
				
				<br />they pledged their faith to me.
				
				<br />And I dreamt that one of that noble host
				
				<br />came forth my hand to claim.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />But I also dreamt which charmed me most
				
				<br />that you loved me still the same
				
				<br />that you loved me
				
				<br />you loved me still the same,
				
				<br />that you loved me
				
				<br />you loved me still the same.

				<h4><a name="On_My_Way_Home"></a>On My Way Home lyrics</h4>
				
				<em>Roma Ryan</em>
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I have been given one moment from heaven
				
				<br />as I am walking surrounded by night,
				
				<br />Stars high above me
				
				<br />make a wish under moonlight.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />On my way home
				
				<br />I remember only good days.
				
				<br />I'm on my way home
				
				<br />I can remember every new day.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />I move in silence with each step taken,
				
				<br />snow falling round me like angels in flight,
				
				<br />Far in the distance
				
				<br />is my wish under moonlight.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />On my way home
				
				<br />I remember only good days.
				
				<br />On my way home
				
				<br />I remember all the best days.
				
				<br />I'm on my way home
				
				<br />I can remember every new day.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up, adieu.
				
				<br />Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up, adieu.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />On my way home
				
				<br />I remember only good days.
				
				<br />On my way home
				
				<br />I remember only good days.

				<h3><a name="linearnotes"></a>Linear notes</h3>
				
				<p>Written by Enya's lyricist, <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma Ryan</a>, in <em>Only Time: The Colletion</em>.</p>
				
				<h4>Watermark</h4>
				
				<p><em>Has the night taken from you
					<br>the one who loves you?
					
					<br>No. Love is forever.
					
					<br>In your eyes is the sadness of one
					
					<br>who remembers their loss.
					
					<br>Love will not leave you.
					
					<br>
					
					<br>Love does not fall under a name or
					
					<br>the mark on a page.
					
					<br>Love is unencumbered,
					
					<br>it's free and it's pure and it's brave.
					
					<br>In your heart is the island
					
					<br>where memories wash on the shore.
					
					<br>Love is an ocean.
					
					<br>Has the night taken from you
					
					<br>the one who belongs to you?
					
					<br>
					
					<br>
					
					No. Love is forever.</em></p>
				
				<p>The title of the track from the album "Watermark" was
					inspired by a poem I had written at that time. It remained as a
					poem and was not adapted for lyric. This is the first time the poem
					has been in print. The track was later used for the tribute album
					for Princess Diana, the proceeds of which went to the memorial fund
					set up in her name.</p>
				
				<h4>Boadicea</h4>
				
				<p>Boadicea or Boudicca, meaning Victorious, was the Queen of the
					Inceni tribe of East Anglia. She led a rebellion in 60 A.D. against
					the Romans, destroying the cities of Colchester, St. Alban's
					and capturing London. She was eventually defeated by the Romans,
					and rather than be humiliated by them, she poisoned herself.</p>
				
				<h4>Storms in Africa</h4>
				
				<p>There are two versions of "Storms in Africa", one in
					Gaelic and one in English. The Gaelic version is our personal
					favourite, which we have included here. Both versions were released
					as a single in 1989.</p>
				
				<h4>The Celts</h4>
				
				<p>This was the main title theme for the series. There were six
					programmes in the series with 72 minutes of music recorded. The
					director had various pastiches in the programme and wanted music to
					compliment these. Thus the music ranges from a "Spaghetti
					Western" through to "The Third Man" and "The
					Haunted House" to the more familiar tracks embodied on the
					soundtrack album. What happened to the other tracks? I hear
					you say. We still have them!</p>
				
				<h4>Orinoco Flow</h4>
				
				<p>Although it was the last track written for the album "Watermark"
					it was the first track to be released, and with great success.
					There was a sense of discovery in the creating of this album, a
					sense of beginning, a sense of something new and exciting. "Orinoco
					Flow" reflects the feeling of that time for us - adventure!</p>
				
				<h4>Ebudae</h4>
				
				<p>Ebudae, latin for the Hebrides, is referred to in Ariosto's
					"Orlando Furioso" as the Dreadful Isle or the Isle of Tears. It is
					also home to the "waulking songs" the rhythm of which is the
					inspiration for this piece. "Waulking songs" come from the
					tradition of women weaving and chanting to the unrelenting rhythm
					of the looms.</p>
				
				<h4>Book of Days</h4>
				
				<p>"Book of Days" was adapted from its original instrumental form
					as it first appeared on the album "Shepherd Moons", for the Ron
					Howard film "Far and Away" which starred Tom Cruise and Nicole
					Kidman. The lyrics were written around the theme of the film.</p>
				
				<h4>Shepherd Moons</h4>
				
				<p>Two tiny new moons had been discovered. Shepherd moons orbiting
					the outer ring of Saturn. Numbered, not named. Working ceaselessly,
					it seemed, to keep the particles of the ring together, much as a
					shepherd would guide his flock. Protectors both, 1980S26 and
					1980S27 - either side of the F ring. Voyager had performed like a
					dream and sent pictures to Earth. An unspoken glory to the rings of
					Saturn. The world had not known but all the time they were there,
					working tirelessly. Everyone had appreciated the spectacular beauty
					of Saturn, but where would the planet be without those precious,
					mis-shaped, miniature moons?</p>
				
				<h4>Caribbean Blue</h4>
				
				<p>Like "Afer Ventus", the wind from Africa or Eurus, the east wind
					or the gentle Zephyrus, the imagination is free and can choose to
					create its own journey. As with all dreams, we reach for the ideal
					and "Caribbean Blue" represents such a dream. The lyrics can be
					summed up in three words: Believe in yourself.</p>
				
				<h4>Marble Halls</h4>
				
				<p>An operatic piece originally scored by the Irish composer,
					Michael William Balfe (1808 - 1870) with lyrics by Alfred Bunn.
					"Marble Halls", or "The Dream" as it is also known, is from the
					1843 opera "The Bohemian Girl", which enjoyed great success during
					Balfe's lifetime. Balfe was once complemented by Strauss as being
					the "Master of Melody". "The Bohemian Girl", and in particular this
					song, is a favourite of Enya.</p>
				
				<h4>The Memory of Trees</h4>
				
				<p>In ancient Celtic belief trees had spirits within them and were
					considered sacred. They were the keepers of memory and lore. The
					Druids, the men of knowledge, used to record their wisdoms by means
					of a secret alphabet called Ogham, which is also called the
					"Tree Alphabet". Ogham is named after the God Ogma, the
					God of poetry and eloquence. Thus the memory of trees looks into
					the past.</p>
				
				<p>The future we look at may give us another interpretation of the
					title, with the destruction of the world's rainforests it may
					turn out to be that the memory of trees is nothing more than that
					for us - a memory.</p>
				
				<h4>Anywhere Is</h4>
				
				<p>Well, it is, isn't it?</p>
				
				<h4>China Roses</h4>
				
				<p>Everyone has their own idea of heaven. What creates the beauty
					of the world is the love we have for it, connected to memories,
					wishes, desires.&nbsp; For each of us it is a different treasure we
					embrace - a changing sky, the crimson flower of the keys of heaven,
					a love token, the endless delight of fairytales, the ever-shifting
					pictures of our world that we find in the word of poets.&nbsp; For
					each one of us, a different love becomes our own wood of
					dreams.&nbsp; Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque: All men,
					in short, do not admire and love the same things.</p>
