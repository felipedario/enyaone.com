<p>Enya's timeless masterpiece, <strong><em>Shepherd Moons</em></strong>, made a resounding impact upon its release in November 1991, securing the coveted Grammy Award for "Best New Age Album" in 1993. This celebrated album exists in multiple versions, each offering its own unique allure. The initial 1991 release showcased a Gaelic language-only rendition of the captivating track <a href="#Book_Of_Days">"Book of Days"</a>. However, Enya's musical journey took an intriguing turn when an English and Gaelic adaptation of the same song found its way into the evocative soundtrack of the film  <a href="enya-songs-albums.html#farandaway"><em>Far And Away</em></a>. Subsequent pressings of the album featured a re-recording of this dual-language rendition, replacing the original Gaelic-only version.</p>

<em>Traditional</em><br />

<br />

My life goes on in endless song<br />

above earth's lamentations,<br />

I hear the real, though far-off hymn<br />

that hails a new creation.<br />

<br />

Through all the tumult and the strife<br />

I hear its music ringing,<br />

It sounds an echo in my soul.<br />

How can I keep from singing?<br />

<br />

While though the tempest loudly roars,<br />

I hear the truth, it liveth.<br />

And though the darkness 'round me close,<br />

songs in the night it giveth.<br />

<br />

No storm can shake my inmost calm,<br />

while to that rock I'm clinging.<br />

Since love is lord of heaven and earth<br />

how can I keep from singing?<br />

<br />

When tyrants tremble in their fear<br />

and hear their death knell ringing,<br />

when friends rejoice both far and near<br />

how can I keep from singing?<br />

<br />

In prison cell and dungeon vile<br />

our thoughts to them are winging,<br />

when friends by shame are undefiled<br />

how can I keep from singing?<br />

I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls<br />

I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,<br />

that knights upon bended knee<br />

and with vows no maidens heart could withstand,<br />

they pledged their faith to me.<br />

And I dreamt that one of that noble host<br />

came forth my hand to claim.<br />

<br />

But I also dreamt which charmed me most<br />

that you loved me still the same<br />

that you loved me<br />

you loved me still the same,<br />

<h4>Shepherd Moons</h4>

<p>Two tiny new moons had been discovered. Shepherd Moons orbiting a ring of
Saturn. Numbered, not named. Working ceaselessly, it seemed, to keep the
particles of the ring together, much as a shepherd would guide his flock.
Protectors both, 1980S26 and 1980S27 - either side of the F rings. Voyager had
performed like a dream and sent their pictures to Earth. I marvelled at their
diligence, a new mystery, poignant and beautiful. An unspoken glory to the rings
of Saturn. The world had not known but all the time they were there, working
tirelessly. Everyone had appreciated the spectacular beauty of Saturn, but where
would the planet be without those precious, mis-shapen, miniature moons?</p>

<h4>Caribbean Blue</h4>

<p>It is much easier to imagine a beautiful place on a rainy day than to imagine
a dreary one. It is a simple fact, often forgotten, that people may create
something good merely by thinking it so. A day-dream is as rich a gift as any.
Like Afer Ventus, the wind from Africa, or Eurus, the East wind, Boreas from the
North or the gentle Zephyrus, the imagination is free and can choose and create
its own journey. As with all dreams we reach for the ideal, and 'Caribbean Blue'
represents such a dream.</p>

<h4>How Can I Keep from Singing?</h4>

<p>This is based on an old Shaker hymn which I suggested as a suitable addition
to the album, not only because of the beautiful melody, but the lyrical content
seems as relevant today as it did 250 years ago when the hymn was written.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the Shakers are known to the world at large mainly for
their ability to build and design beautiful furniture. The Shakers also wrote
beautiful music and songs with which they glorified their joy in living. They
lived very simple lives and their melodies reflect the beauty inherent in this
simplicity.</p>

<p>It is not widely known that in 1846 the Shakers sent food to Ireland in an
attempt to relieve the suffering during the famine, and this also held
significance in our decision to arrange the piece.</p>

<h4>Ebudae</h4>

<p>I had come across Ebudae in Ariosto's classic tale of Orlando Furioso, the
island thought to be intended as one of the Hebrides, referred to as the
Dreadful Isle or the Isle Of Tears. I had fallen in love with the name, and when
sometime later I was browsing through an old book of ancient maps, I was
delighted to find Ebud&amp;ae actually recorded and in this original form! The title
of the song 'Ebudae' and the lyrics concern themselves with ancient sounds.</p>

<p>There are two 'voices' which work their way through the piece. The first
voice concerns itself with the story - which is loosely based on the tradition
of women weaving and chanting to the rhythm of their work. The second voice is a
mixture of sounds and fragments of sounds half-invented, half-remembered from
childhood. As is often the case, what one actually hears and what one thinks one
hears can be two very different things. With this rhythmic section we try to
capture those impressions.</p>

<h4>Angeles</h4>

<p>At times we ask for extraordinary things to happen in our lives and somehow,
deep down, we believe that they will. Someone, somewhere, may have the power to
help us - a Guardian Angel perhaps, some spiritual minder, a protector from
life's darker moments.</p>

<p>Such a belief can be a comfort in life, an easy relationship with a world
beyond our own. A gentle hand on your shoulder to guide you through, though not
away from, the harder times.</p>

<h4>No Holly For Miss Quinn</h4>

<p>A partner piece to 'Miss Clare Remembers' (<a href="watermark.html"<em>Watermark</em></a>). 'No Holly For
Miss Quinn' was prompted by another Miss Read story. The idyllic descriptions of
country and village life and the simple portraits of those who peopled such
settings had appeal to Enya. In composing this music she recaptures the naivety
and innocence of an age and place far removed from the whirl and pressure of our
sophisticated society and suggests that we need to dip into that world from time
to time.</p>

<h4>Book Of Days</h4>

<p>I am collecting diaries more and more and I continue to be intrigued by the
possibilities of each blank page - what will it hold? I experience a mixture of
sadness and exuberance when I think of lives laid out on a page or in a book.
Personal histories of great loves, of journeys exotic and wonderful, of loss,
fear and tragedy, of dreams and simple wishes.</p>

<h4>Evacuee</h4>

<p>I remember her face. She told of how she had been an evacuee during the
Second World War. As she told her story she began to cry like the girl she had
been half a century ago. The pain of her separation from her parents registered
with immediacy on her face. As a child she could not understand why she had to
leave them, and the effect of this had stayed with her. The only hope she had as
a child was a promise that they would all be together again.</p>

<h4>Lothl�rien</h4>

<p>Sam felt as if he were inside a song when he described Lothl�rien, the land
of enchantment and wonder in J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>Lord Of The Rings</em>. Lothl�rien
is as beautiful as a dream, as pure as the dawn of creation and as old as the
beginning of time. Here, the leaves of the Mallorn trees in Autumn do not fall,
but turn to gold.</p>

<p>Various translations and suggested origins of the name Lothl�rien give us
colourful and imaginative expressions such as 'the vale of the land of singers',
'the valley of the singing Gold' and 'Dreamflower'.</p>

<h4>Marble Halls</h4>

<p>An operatic piece originally scored by the Irish composer and baritone,
Michael William Balfe (1808-1870). 'Marble Halls', or 'The Dream' as it is also
known, is from his 1843 opera <em>The Bohemian Girl</em>, which enjoyed great
success during his lifetime. Balfe was once complimented by Strauss as being the
Master of Melody. <em>The Bohemian Girl</em>, and in particular this song, is a
favourite of both Enya and her mother.</p>

<h4>Afer Ventus</h4>

<p>The moment experienced when everything in life suddenly makes sense - when
everything fits into place and we know why - is a rare moment, but it does
happen. If we are lucky enough we can bathe in the brevity of that moment for it
passes as quickly as it arrives. Like Joyce's 'Epiphanies' they can sometimes
seem trivial, but are always crucial and revealing moments in our lives,
delicate and fleeting.</p>

<p>In 'Afer Ventus' it is those moments of pure enlightenment which are
described.</p>

<h4>Smaointe... (D'Aodh Agus Do Mh�ire U� Dh�gain)</h4>

<p>The story of the beach at Maragallen (The Plain of the Shelter) is that many years past, a great wave swept onto the land, crashing down upon
the small church and graveyard, destroying the church. All who were in the
church that day, perished.</p>

<p>It is in this same graveyard that Enya's grandparents are buried. Enya often
talked to me of how she could see the graveyard as she walked along the shores
of the Maragallen, and of how she felt her grandparents were watching over her
and guiding her still. Memories of her childhood and days spent with them come
to Enya when she walks there, memories which she will treasure always. I wrote
'Smaointe' in response to these reflections. The word 'smaointe' literally
translated means 'thoughts'.</p>
