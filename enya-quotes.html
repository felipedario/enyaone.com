<h3>KSCA interview (1996)</h3>

<p style="font-size:.9em;"><a href="http://www.musicandmeaning.com/site/enya_ksca.html"><em>The
Memory of Trees</em> promotional interview with Merilee Kelly</a>
of KSCA 101.9 FM (18 January 1996)</p>

<p>"I think they find it &mdash; they find me quite
confusing, because &mdash; they know the music, but they don't know
anything about me ... because I keep a very private lifestyle so they
end up ... making up stories as such. But I don't really concern myself
too much about them." -- On the music press</p>



<p>"On the project <a href="the-celts-documentary.html"><em>The Celts</em></a> I was asked to ... to write a song.
And, at the time I was ... arranging with <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky</a>, and writing the music
and performing ... so, no desire whatsoever to write lyrics!... But
<a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma</a> was actually writing poetry at the time, and she was involved,
with listening in the studio ... being the audience in the studio ...
so she was involved with the project. So, it was very obvious that she
would write the lyrics."</p>


<p>"There is no set sort of rules, or no set sort of formula to
the way we work in the studio ... so it's difficult to know ... what
we'll move on to next. We don't like to say, "Never, no we'd never do
this" ... But, we ... like the setup as far as there's only three
people in the studio ... because the work is very personal, very
intimate, very emotional ... and that is very important to the album."</p>

<p>"I get very inspired by traveling, by being home in Donegal
... all those wonderful moments I'll take with me to the studio. And
they, ah, then become at some stage, a melody. That emotion that I
loved at some stage will evolve as a melody."</p>


<p>"For me, I've derived from religion ... what... I enjoy ...
and it's to go to church, but usually ... when there's nobody else
there. I just love that moment, ah, to just sit there. It's very
peaceful, very calm, and very therapeutic, and it's ... wonderful."</p>


<p>"A lot of people tend to think that because I need all this
time on my own in the studio, that I need time on my own, period. And
that's not really true."</p>


<h3><em>The Telegraph</em> interview (2005)</h3>


<p style="font-size:.9em;"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/11/24/bmenya24.xml">"Everyone
thinks I'm so shockable" interview with Neil McCormick</a> in The
Telegraph (24 November 2005)</p>


<p>"I like to stay up-to-date with what's happening musically ...
I wish people wouldn't think that such things were going to shock me.
'Wow! Does Enya really watch TV?'"</p>


<p>"Regardless of how I live my life, there are people who develop
fixations that are not healthy. It could be a visual thing, or it could
be the music that they are drawn to. These people need help."</p>


<p>"I do promotion when it is necessary ... But I always want to
get back to the music. The personal appearances and red carpet events
are very glitzy, but it's a bit false."</p>


<p>"I'm not one for walking the beaches humming a melody ... I
love the discipline of sitting in the studio, writing and listening.
That is my domain."</p>


<p>"They are as much "Enya" as I am." -- On her producer <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky Ryan</a> and
her lyricist, his wife <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma Ryan</a>.</p>


<p>"There is no formula to it because writing every song, for me,
is a little journey. The first note has to lift you and make you go,
'What's this?' You play C, but why is it that one day it leads to G and
it didn't yesterday? I don't know. It's everything. It's the walk you
take in the morning, it's the night before, the meeting with people,
landscapes, the chats, all of that evolves in some way into melody, but
I'm not sure how it's going to happen. I'm dealing with the unknown all
the time and that is exciting."</p>


<p>"I suppose there's a certain way I like the music to be
performed, and I feel I can capture it better than anyone else. I know
every note in every song, the whole history of it, even parts that were
there and are gone."</p>


<p>"The word <em>workaholic</em> is so severe, but I
do focus a lot on my work ... I think a lot about what I'm doing in all
aspects of my life, what am I trying to achieve here, am I happy with
this? Music is like a mirror in front of you. You're exposing
everything, but surely that's better than suppressing. ... You have to
dig deep and that can be hard for anybody, no matter what profession. I
feel that I need to actually push myself to the limit to feel happy
with the end result."</p>


<h3><em>The Times Magazine</em> interview (2005)</h3>


<p style="font-size:.9em;"><a href="http://women.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17909-1916580,00.html">"The
Invisible Star" interview with Nigel Williamson</a> in <em>The
Times Magazine</em> (10 December 2005)</p>


<p>"I could have been more famous if I did all the glitzy things,
but celebrity always seemed so unnecessary ... Fame and success are
very different things, anyway. The music sold itself before anybody
knew who I was, so I felt I had a choice. I told the record company I
didn't feel the need to be out there at red-carpet events. I wanted a
career. But I wanted to keep myself intact as a person."</p>


<p>"I started writing instrumentals but <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma</a> pointed out they
were very visual, so she started writing lyrics .. and <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky</a> had this
idea of creating a wall of sound and started multi-tracking my voice."</p>


<p>"I didn't expect such a huge reaction, but I knew I was doing
something different to everything else that was happening at the time
... People feel a very personal connection with the music."</p>


<p>"There might be one little thing that makes all the
difference, one note or one word. The fine-tuning is all important, and
you've got to stay there until you get it right ... That's why it can
take years."</p>


<h3><em>Women's Weekly</em> interview (2006)</h3>

<p style="font-size:.9em;"><a href="http://enya.sk/2012/06/the-invisible-superstar/">"Enya
- The invisible superstar" interview with William Langley</a> in <em>Women's Weekly</em> (January 2006)</p>

<p>"I am really a very shy person ... If I appear, it is because
of the music, not because I want to be seen. I'm not a recluse. I like
to go out, but I don't like the glitziness that goes with it."</p>

<p>"I'm very happy as I am. I realise that I made sacrifices
early in my career and that it was hard on my relationships because,
when I am working, I am very focused and it isn't easy, when you have
been in the studio all day, to say to someone, 'I'll meet up with you
later on.' I learned that it was necessary to be dedicated and put work
first. But, at the same time, it was a wonderful feeling to be
successful at doing something I loved."</p>

<p>"When I left school, I had a list of priorities headed by
'marriage' and 'children'. That is how, I suppose, as a woman, you are
brought up to think. At the same time, as I grew older, I told myself
that if it happens, it happens, and that will be fine, but if it
doesn't, that will be fine, too."</p>

<p>"I loved to talk about music to <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky</a> ... His influence came
from people like The Beatles and The Beach Boys, and he had these ideas
about layering vocals, painting landscapes with music. <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma</a> knew about
Irish mythology, told stories, wrote poetry and had this special
feeling for lyrics. My grounding came from the classics."</p>

<p>"Sitting and writing music on your own makes you think a lot
about your life. Who are you? Would you change anything about yourself?
This is where it comes from. It is like having a mirror held up in
front of you, looking into yourself and asking these questions."</p>

<p>"What I was looking for was a romantic athmosphere that I
could feel at home with. I think I've achieved that. I love my home. I
have friends round. I take care to live in it, not to work in it." --
On her castle</p>

<p>"I'm sometimes asked what are the pluses and minuses of
celebrity ... and, for me, the biggest plus is being successful at
something that I love to do. The minuses, unfortunately, include having
to live with security and the knowledge that you may be stalked. ... I
do like people ... I have lots of friends, but I can only be who I am."</p>

<h3><em>You</em> interview (2006)</h3>


<p style="font-size:.9em;"><a href="http://enya.sk/2012/06/from-the-heart/">"From
the Heart" interview with Maureen Paton</a> in <em>You</em>
(8 January 2006)</p>

<p>"I live in Victorian Gothic castle in Killiney that I was so
bold as to rename Manderley, because Daphne du Maurier 's Rebecca is
one of my favourite books. ... People have this image of me as an
ethereal Lady of Shalott, floating across the battlements, but it's a
very small castle as castles go &mdash; with no big ballrooms... I
don't write my music in my home, only in the studio; I want as normal
life as possible at home, with dinner parties and entertaining."</p>

<p>"The success of Watermark surprised me. I never thought of
music as something commercial; it was something very personal to me...
The writing of a melody is an emotional moment; success doesn't make it
easy."</p>

<p>"I felt as if we were two families: the older ones, who were
away touring when I was at school and the younger ones. I was closer to
my two younger sisters because of the nearness of our ages, but I feel
I would have to have permission to say their names &mdash; they're
very private that way."</p>

<p>"I joined my family's band, Clannad , as a teenager in 1980 to
sing harmonies and play keyboards, but it wasn't musically chalenging
for me; I felt like an outsider. ... My split from Clannad two years
later caused a conflict of loyalty for a time, because I went off with
their manager <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky Ryan</a>, who had asked me to join Clannad in the first
place."</p>

<p>"Enya is more than just me. It's also <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky</a>, who arranges my
melodies, and his wife <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma</a>, who writes the lyrics. They believed in my
music from day one"</p>

<p>"I have never come close to being married or engaged. I was
with someone eight years ago when I questioned whether I wanted the
pressure of being married or having children. I always felt that if
pregnancy was to happen, it would happen; if it didn't, it didn't. ...
I have security, I don't need a man in my life. I don't have pets, I
have two guard dogs; and I don't do my own shopping; it's a security
thing....The downside of success is stalkers. I have had death threats
from people with fixations who need help."</p>

<h3>Quotations about Enya</h3>

<p>"Enya left school in 1979, and we had already been a nucleus,
so it was probably difficult for her. She wanted to go off and do her
own thing. Tensions were created because we never answered any of the
questions. If you're going to answer questions, people aren't going to
believe you anyway. The proof of the pudding is that Enya is my sister,
and I love her dearly, and we get on really, really well." --
M&aacute;ire Brennan, On rumors of ill will between Enya and her
family members who were also former Clannad bandmates</p>

<p>"She does have a life. She'd kill me if I talked about it, so
I'm not going to talk about it. There's a difference between being a
private person and a recluse. All this blushed and flushed stuff about
her being a recluse put it to bed, for God's sake." -- <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky
Ryan</a></p>

<p>"Enya never writes a bad melody. That's first and foremost her
secret. As she goes along, she'll start changing the dynamics, pushing
here and there so that not everything is perfectly in unison. It adds a
texture you can acquire only from having different voices. The
variations lead to interesting quirks. It's an integral part of the
Enya sound." -- <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky
Ryan</a></p>

<p>"Enya knew nothing about recording, about production or
arrangements. Originally, we were stock-piling music and just letting
her get on with it. There was no name on the music she was writing. All
I knew was that hard work succeeded." -- <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky
Ryan</a></p>

<p>"I heard the soundtrack to The Celts TV programme, which Enya
had done, and I thought "what's this magical music?", and it was such
an antidote to the, sort of, the day's work, that every night I went
home and played the soundtrack from The Celts. And then I met her in
Ireland and she was telling me how she was signing to another record
company, I went "no, no, no, no, you can't do this, you must sign with
us." And I did it really just as a self-indulgence, that I thought this
was beautiful music and wanted to be associated with it, there wasn't
really a kind of commercial edge to it at all." -- Rob Dickins, former
chairman of Warner Music UK</p>

<p>"Sometimes the company is there to make money, sometimes it's
there to make music. Enya was the latter. I would have been a genius if
I knew this was going to sell millions of records. I just wanted to be
involved with this music." -- Rob Dickins</p>

<p>"Enya and her team record and we stay in touch until there is
something for me to listen to. I then provide an outside view. She is a
genius in the studio, comparable to somebody like Brian Wilson, but she
and Nicky can be their own worst enemies at striving for personal best
all the time. I guess that's the price of perfectionism." -- Rob Dickins</p>

<p>"There's something about Celtic mythology which is deep in the
soul, and I just think that somehow she has tapped right into it." --
Rob Dickins</p>
