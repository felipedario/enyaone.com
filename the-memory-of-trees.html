					<p>Its cover art was inspired by a painting called <a href="MaxfieldParrish_YoungKing.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"The Young
						King of the Black Isles"</a> by Maxfield Parrish, whose work has inspired
						many of her music videos as well.</p>
					
					<p>As <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma Ryan</a>, Enya's lyricist, remarks in the linear notes of the <a href="#The_Memory_Of_Trees">The Memory Of Trees</a> song for the later colletion <a href="paint-the-sky-with-stars.html"><em>Paint The Sky With Stars</em></a>, "In ancient Celtic belief trees had spirits within them and were
						considered sacred. They were the keepers of memory and lore. <em>(...)</em> The future we look at may give us another interpretation of the title, with the destruction of the world's rainforests it may
						turn out to be  that the memory of trees is nothing more than that
						for us - a memory."</p>

					<em>Roma Ryan</em>
					
					<br />
					
					<br />I walk the maze of moments
					
					<br />but everywhere I turn to
					
					<br />begins a new beginning
					
					<br />but never finds a finish
					
					<br />I walk to the horizon
					
					<br />and there I find another
					
					<br />it all seems so surprising
					
					<br />and then I find that I know
					
					<br />
					
					<br />CHORUS:
					
					<br />You go there you're gone forever
					
					<br />I go there I'll lose my way
					
					<br />if we stay here we're not together
					
					<br />Anywhere is
					
					<br />
					
					<br />The moon upon the ocean
					
					<br />is swept around in motion
					
					<br />but without ever knowing
					
					<br />the reason for its flowing
					
					<br />in motion on the ocean
					
					<br />the moon still keeps on moving
					
					<br />the waves still keep on waving
					
					<br />and I still keep on going
					
					<br />
					
					<br />CHORUS
					
					<br />
					
					<br />I wonder if the stars sign
					
					<br />the life that is to be mine
					
					<br />and would they let their light shine
					
					<br />enough for me to follow
					
					<br />I look up to the heavens
					
					<br />but night has clouded over
					
					<br />no spark of constellation
					
					<br />no Vela no Orion
					
					<br />
					
					<br />The shells upon the warm sands
					
					<br />have taken from their own lands
					
					<br />the echo of their story
					
					<br />but all I hear are low sounds
					
					<br />as pillow words are weaving
					
					<br />and willow waves are leaving
					
					<br />but should I be believing
					
					<br />that I am only dreaming
					
					<br />
					
					<br />CHORUS
					
					<br />
					
					<br />To leave the thread of all time
					
					<br />and let it make a dark line
					
					<br />in hopes that I can still find
					
					<br />the way back to the moment
					
					<br />I took the turn and turned to
					
					<br />begin a new beginning
					
					<br />still looking for the answer
					
					<br />I cannot find the finish
					
					<br />It's either this or that way
					
					<br />it's one way or the other
					
					<br />it should be one direction
					
					<br />it could be on reflection
					
					<br />the turn I have just taken
					
					<br />the turn that I was making
					
					<br />I might be just beginning
					
					<br />I might be near the end.

					<br />
					
					<br />Who can tell me if we have heaven,
					
					<br />who can say the way it should be;
					
					<br />Moonlight holly, the Sappho Comet,
					
					<br />Angel's tears below a tree.
					
					<br />
					
					<br />You talk of the break of morning
					
					<br />as you view the new aurora,
					
					<br />Cloud in crimson, the key of heaven,
					
					<br />one love carved in acajou.
					
					<br />
					
					<br />One told me of China Roses,
					
					<br />One a Thousand nights and one night,
					
					<br />Earth's last picture, the end of evening:
					
					<br />hue of indigo and blue.
					
					<br />
					
					<br />A new moon leads me to
					
					<br />woods of dreams and I follow.
					
					<br />A new world waits for me;
					
					<br />my dream, my way.
					
					<br />
					
					<br />I know that if I have heaven
					
					<br />there is nothing to desire.
					
					<br />Rain and river, a world of wonder
					
					<br />may be paradise to me.

					<br />I see the sun...

					<br />
					
					<br />One look at love and you may see
					
					<br />it weaves a web over mystery,
					
					<br />all ravelled threads can rend apart
					
					<br />for hope has a place in the lover's heart.
					
					<br />Hope has a place in a lover's heart.
					
					<br />
					
					<br />Whispering world, a sigh of sighs,
					
					<br />The ebb and the flow of the ocean tides.
					
					<br />One breath, one word may end or may start
					
					<br />a hope in a place of the lover's heart.
					
					<br />Hope has a place in a lover's heart.
					
					<br />
					
					<br />Look to love you may dream,
					
					<br />and if it should leave then give it wings.
					
					<br />But if such a love is meant to be;
					
					<br />Hope is home, and the heart is free
					
					<br />
					
					<br />Under the heavens we journey far,
					
					<br />on roads of life we're the wanderers,
					
					<br />So let love rise, so let love depart,
					
					<br />Let hope have a place in the lover's heart.
					
					<br />Hope has a place in a lover's heart.
					
					<br />
					
					<br />Look to love and you may dream,
					
					<br />and if it should leave then give it wings.
					
					<br />But if such a love is meant to be;
					
					<br />Hope is home, and the heart is free.

					<h4>Anywhere Is</h4>
					
					<p>The land of the summer stars... the winter garden...that way...the land of paradoxes...the 
						city of angels...aigle... anywhere is...roma...the island of ebony....</p>

					<h4>Pax Deorum</h4>
					
					<p>Pax Deorum translates as "Peace of the Gods" <em>[Enya Lyrics note: the correct is "Peace of God". Peace of the Gods may be "Pax Deorim"]</em>. This Goodwill of God expressed accord between ancient Rome and her Gods, maintaining a
						harmonious relationship between Man and Divinity. This concept, and
						variations of it, are echoed throughout history in other ages and
						cultures.</p>
					
					<h4>Athair Ar Neamh</h4>
					
					<p>...the voice of epiphany is found in Athair ar Neamh. It is the
						voice of day, the voice of night, the voice of all, of understanding.</p>
					
					<p>It is a peace which is unique to the individual, a peace that is felt
						rather than described. It is that moment in which we experience a sense
						of calm and understanding amidst the bustle and hustle of everyday
						living, and although it is a brief encounter, it is complete.</p>
					
					<h4>China Roses</h4>
					
					<p>Everyone has their own idea of heaven. What creates the beauty of
						the world is the love we have for it, connected to memories, wishes,
						desires. For each of us it is a different treasure we embrace - a
						changing sky, the crimson flower of the Keys of Heaven, a love token,
						the endless delight of fairy-tales, the ever-shifting pictures of our
						world that we find in the words of poets. For each one of us a
						different love becomes our own woo of dreams.</p>
					
					<p>Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque: All men, in short, do not admire and love the same things.</p>
					
					<h4>Hope Has A Place</h4>
					
					<p>Hope has a place in the lover's heart.</p>
					
					<p>If love was always kind there would be no need to worry for those who
						begin this journey. On Love or the loss of it, no amount of advice or
						reason can ultimately protect the one who loves from pain or from the
						disappointment of loss. We hurt so much because we love so much.</p>
					
					<p>This is a wish that love may be kind, and if it should not be, that the
						one precious feeling held captive in Pandora's box may find it's place
						in the lover's heart.</p>
					
					<h4>Tea-House Moon</h4>
					
					<p>It has been told that the path to the tea-house was one of a copse
						of summer trees, a wave of the sea, the pale evening moon. The trees,
						the sea, the moon evoked old dreams and the tea-house represented an
						oasis where the traveller could find peace. On entering through the low
						door, one could hear the song of water echo the distant sea or the
						sound of the rain in a bamboo forest. The tea-house was a place of
						repose and one in which the harmony of nature pervaded.</p>
					
					<h4>Once You Had Gold</h4>
					
					<p>For some it will be the memory of darkness and their journey thought
						it. Looking back to the walk though winter into vernal days. Knowing
						that all things must pass; both good and bad.</p>
					
					<p>For others it is the mother reassuring her child. The ways of the world
						hold both darkness and dreams. Every day has it's ending and every
						night it's new dawn. And, although Summer sheds to winter, days will
						once again become bright.</p>
					
					<p>Others will see the path which took them from one understanding to
						another; once in which they realised that which was most precious to
						them.</p>
					
					<h4>La Sonadora</h4>
					
					<p>From the mythologies of our origins to the dreams of Borges and
						beyond. From probable to the abstract, from the one to the many, from
						the dreamer to the bedreamed.</p>
					
					<p>In Irish Mythology there is often mention of the Druid; The Druid was
						regarded as a man of knowledge and power. He held the knowledge in
						dreams and signs an interpretation. He knew the lie of lands and the
						way of the winds. He understood the elements. His was the knowledge of
						words. One Druid in particular inspired the seed to this lyric;
						Amergin, who came from the shores of Iberia, modern-day Spain, with the
						Son of Mil.</p>
					
					<p>And so the Dreamer dreams.</p>
					
					<h4>On My Way Home</h4>
					
					<p>The journey home. A clear, fresh evening, quiet, restful. Thoughts
						are comforting, memories are warm and sweet. The air is so still
						reflection comes easy. A gentle snow may cocoon us and can deaden the
						night sounds, The mind can dwell on the good things in life as, with
						each step, one joyful thought begets another. The journey home is
						filled with the anticipation and excitement of arrival - family,
						friends, those we love. The solitary path has more room for wishes, in
						that stillness, in that night, going home.</p>
