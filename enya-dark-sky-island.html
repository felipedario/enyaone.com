<p>Enya's highly anticipated album, <em>Dark Sky Island</em>, took the music world by storm upon its release on November 20th, 2015, marking her latest musical endeavor. The singer herself revealed the album's impending arrival through an announcement on her official website in September 2015, sparking excitement among her dedicated fan base. Building anticipation further, on October 7th, 2015, <a href="enya-biography.html">Enya</a> unveiled the album's captivating title, its lead single, and the complete track listing, heightening the intrigue surrounding the forthcoming musical masterpiece.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3X8qn8l" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Download MP3s and listen to on Amazon</a></p>

<p>Notably, "Dark Sky Island" not only made its mark in digital formats with <a href="https://amzn.to/3GN8zbM">standard</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3kofpNm">deluxe editions</a> but also made a resounding impact in the <a href="http://amzn.to/1RxMsp0">vinyl</a> realm. This release marked a significant milestone as Enya's first vinyl offering since the <a href="/the-celts.html">re-release of her first album</a> back in 1992, adding an extra layer of allure for vinyl enthusiasts and collectors.</p>

<p>The album's title itself draws inspiration from the enchanting designation of the island of Sark as a "dark sky island." Additionally, it finds resonance with a collection of poetry books by Roma Ryan that explores the theme of islands. Signifying a powerful union of inspiration and creativity, the title track, "Dark Sky Island," emerged as the first composition crafted for the album, setting the tone for the musical journey that lay ahead.</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>
		This album has a theme of journeys. Journeys to the island; through the length of a lifetime; through history, through emotions; and journeys across great oceans. So although it's not a 'themed' album, as such, we nevertheless have an underlying connection between songs.
	</p>
	<em>Enya</em>
</blockquote>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x74kTbUreQQ">album 'introduction' video</a>, Enya talked about the background of the album.</p>

<p>She explained: "We take so long to put an album together, that it's important to us to give ourselves the time in the studio, but this has meant that we had never really/officially taken a break from the studio, a proper break, so when we finished And Winter Came, we felt that it was time to leave the studio for a while". According to the album's press release and a subsequent interview, during the break Enya bought a new home in France and spent time away from Ireland renovating and adjusting to new surroundings. Aigle Studios also had major renovations that lasted for much of 2011, hence the album's recording did not start until spring 2012. This means that the album itself took three and a half years to complete, the usual time period Enya allocates to perfecting an album, and not six years.</p>

<p>In the interview, Enya was excited and enthusiastic for Dark Sky Island'​s release after having completed the album. "There's a stage, you know, within working on the album that you feel, uh, you have to commit yourself, to a release date. You know eventually you're gonna 'cross the t', 'dot the i' and this is going to finally, um, be finished, so there's an element of excitement".</p>

<p>Enya also took the time show her appreciation for her fans and their loyalty in the interview, and inferred that they give her much motivation when working. "The work in the studio is quite intense, and, to then get feedback of, that there are people waiting to hear the music [...] it's something really lovely to bring to the studio with you".</p>

<p>In the advanced press release for the album, the meaning and descriptions of the album's songs are detailed. In addition, features of the songs not mentioned in the press release are detailed in this section.</p>

<p>Enya herself described the album as having a 'theme of journeys' - "Journeys to the island; through a length of a lifetime; throughout history; throughout emotions; and through journeys across great oceans". Although the album has an underlying connections of journeys, Enya also stated it is not a 'themed album' as her previous winter-themed album And Winter Came was.</p>

<p>Album opener "The Humming" is a song "that muses on the cycle of the universe and how change affects everything". It started off as "a small melody line that Enya began to hum", recalled producer Nicky Ryan. "It's rather appropriate as the title refers to the sound of the early universe which is at around 47 octaves below the lowest piano key". Nicky revealed that scientific work on compressing and pitching the vibration to be audible to humans, "picked up by the Planck space telescope", turned the sound into a humming, giving the song a fitting title. Musically the song was described as infectious and magical, being compared to well-known Enya hits like "Caribbean Blue". "The Humming" does not refer to The Hum however, although it does draw similar parallels.</p>

<p>"So I Could Find My Way" is a slow, sentimental song, set in waltz time and composed in the key of D major. The introduction features gentle church bells, perhaps setting the song in a funeral. The lyrics are a reflection on time spent with a lost one; how the lost one 'sheltered', 'held high' and 'all those years guided', but 'only time keep us apart'. Enya explained the song was dedicated to her producer and friend Nicky Ryan's mother Mona who died some years ago, saying that she 'got to know her very well' once she moved to Dublin. Enya added that it was appropriate to dedicate the song to Mona Ryan as the melody is 'slow, very emotional'. Enya said the subject of 'a mother moving on' is 'something quite universal... You think about what she left behind in your life. That's what you'll always remember. What her stories were, what she was hoping for you; hoping you'd find your way'.</p>

<p>"Even in the Shadows" features a one-off guest appearance courtesy of Irish rock and jazz musician Eddie Lee, who contributes to the tracks "pulsing, insistent rhythm" with double bass. Lee is a member of the Sligo band Those Nervous Animals, who were label mates (under the Tara Music label) of the Brennan family band Clannad in the early 1980s; Enya was a member of Clannad from 1980-1982.</p>

<p>Loxian language, created by the trio's lyricist Roma Ryan, makes a comeback in song on "Dark Sky Island" for the first time since the release of Amarantine and its accompanying book Water Shows the Hidden Heart, in songs "The Forge of Angels" and "The Loxian Gates". These songs in particular focus on the "intergalactic theme" and otherworldly and futuristic tales Roma Ryan uses Loxian for, along with the non-Loxian "Astra et Luna".</p>

<p>The single "Echoes In Rain" has a "buoyant optimism" and the lavish vocal work somewhat reminiscent of "Orinoco Flow". It is played in a minor scale (explicitly F-sharp minor) and has a "marching rhythm celebrating a journey's end". The song includes a piano-based bridge, similar to Enya's piano solo work, and it is the first for a lead single to do so. Enya's vocals span 2 octaves from the low note of B2 to the high note of E5. The lyrics describe the feelings of a long journey home, travelling through night and through day, with the verses detailing how the surroundings and emotions change throughout the journey.</p>

<p>"I Could Never Say Goodbye" is a classic Irish lament Enya has become well known for, with "a sparse, hymnal arrangement".</p>

<p>"Sancta Maria" is a blending of synthesisers and classical instrumentation, to go with the melody that gathers both new and old styles together. The press release called it "almost a history of sound encapsulated in four hypnotic and otherworldly minutes".</p>

<p>
And all the light will be revealed<br>
And all the future prophecy<br>
And all the waves deceive the sea<br>
And on the road are you and me<br>
<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
<br>
And all the winds are like a kiss<br>
And all the years are nemesis<br>
And all the moments fall in mist<br>
And all is dust, remember this<br>
<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
<br>
And all the light will be, will be<br>
And all the waves deceive<br>
And all the waves deceive the sea<br>
When all the light will be<br>
<br>
And all the dust will drift away<br>
And all the nights and all the days<br>
And all the heavens go their way<br>
And only change is here to stay<br>
<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm<br>
<br>
And all the light will be, will be<br>
And all the waves deceive<br>
And all the waves deceive the sea<br>
When all the light will be<br><br>

And all the stars without a name<br>
And all the skies that look the same<br>
And all the clouds that fade and then<br>
Then all of this begins again<br>
<br>
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm</p>

<em>Roma Ryan</em><br />

<p>A thousand dreams you gave to me,<br>
You held me high, you held me high.<br>
And all those years you guided me,<br>
So I could find my way.</p>
<p>How long your love had sheltered me,<br>
You held me high, you held me high.<br>
A harbour holding back the sea,<br>
So I could find my way.</p>
<p>So let me give this dream to you,<br>
Upon another shore.<br>
So let me give this dream to you,<br>
Each night and evermore.</p>
<p>Yet only time keeps us apart,<br>
You held me high, you held me high.<br>
You're in the shadows of my heart,<br>
So I could find my way.</p>
<p>You held me high, you held me high…</p>
<p>So let me give this dream to you,<br>
Upon another shore.<br>
So let me give this dream to you,<br>
Each night and evermore.</p>
<p>A thousand dreams you gave to me,<br>
You held me high, you held me high.<br>
And all those years you guided me,<br>
So I could find my way.</p>
<p>So I could find my way…</p>

<em>Roma Ryan</em><br />

<p>
Even in the shadows<br>
I turn around<br>
to find you walk away<br>
And even when I whisper<br>
the winds will come<br>
to steal the words I say</p>
<p>I could fall and keep on falling<br>
I could call and keep on calling<br>
Wonder why this love is over<br>
Wonder why it's not forever</p>
<p>Even in the silence<br>
I hear my heart<br>
It's still a part of you<br>
And even in the morning<br>
when light has come<br>
I don't know what to do</p>
<p>I could fall and keep on falling<br>
I could call and keep on calling<br>
Wonder why this love is over<br>
Wonder why it's not forever</p>
<p>So high, so low<br>
Love is gone and love is gone...</p>

<p>Night has gone<br>
						Without my tears<br>
						Now I walk alone<br>
						You're no longer here<br>
						<br>
						The days turn to years<br>

						To the silence in my eyes<br>
						You know you are in my heart<br>
						But the miles keep us apart<br>
						<br>
						Time moves on<br>
						In the falling grey<br>
						I still dream of you<br>
						And whisper your name<br>
						Where I see you once again<br>
						<br>
						I could never say goodbye<br>
						To the silence in my eyes<br>
						You know you are in my heart<br>
						But the miles keep us apart<br>

						I could never say goodbye</p>

The blue voice of the sea<br>
And they whisper us they taught the shore<br>
Come back to me, come back to me<br>

The heavens rise<br>
Come back to me, come back to me<br>
Come back to me, come back to me<br>

						Capella...auriga...eta carinae...<br>
						Sagitta...aquila...alpha centauri...<br>

						Moonlight brings the ocean's storms<br>
Like waves upon the sea<br>

Come back to me, come back to me<br>

Come back to me, come back to me<br>

<br>
						Listen to my heart beat<br>
						As I lie dreaming<br>
						Everywhere is whispering<br>
						The sound of summer<br>
						<br>
						The diamonds on the water<br>
						Are falling from the sun<br>
						The diamonds on the water<br>
						Are...are...</p>

<h4><a name="Solace"></a>Solace lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br />

<p>What can I do to comfort you?<br>
Don’t hide away in solitude.<br>
What can I say to show the way?<br>
Let tears become a soft rain…</p>
<p>Why do you hide the loss inside?<br>
The love you feel is in your eyes.<br>
Why do you go upon this road<br>
when you could find your way home?</p>


<h4><a name="Pale_Grass_Blue"></a>Pale Grass Blue lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br />

<p>A silver hue on wings of blue as all<br>
around me shadows dance in light<br>
<em>Sun is high above and winds are still<br>
enough and all I want to do is stay</em><br>
And everywhere the blues are moving<br>
in the air I see them in their flight<br>
<em>Sun is high above and winds are still<br>
enough and all I want to do is stay</em></p>
<p>For seven days they make the sky look<br>
down upon them as they go their way<br>
<em>Sun is high above and winds are still<br>
enough and all I want to do is stay</em></p>
<p>For seven nights they wait the moment<br>
for the morning light to come again<br>
<em>Sun is high above and winds are still<br>
enough and all I want to do is stay</em></p>
<p>And one by one they wander one by<br>
one meander never go astray<br>
<em>Sun is high above and winds are still<br>
enough and all I want to do is stay</em></p>
<p>And so I stand and gaze and so I watch<br>
the maze of blues depart the day<br>
<em>Sun is high above and winds are still<br>
enough and one by one they fly away<br>
Sun is high above and winds are still<br>
enough and one by one they fly away</em></p>


<h4><a name="Remember_Your_Smile"></a>Remember Your Smile lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br />


<p>Lost in the mountains<br>
far from the crowds<br>
we would wander together<br>
walking for miles<br>
with the night still before us<br>
and day passing by<br>
I always remember your smile</p>
<p>Cool in the evening<br>
warm in the sun<br>
the clouds moving slowly<br>
time was undone<br>
yet the days fell before us<br>
and nights rolled on by<br>
I always remember your smile</p>
<p>Every step and each moment<br>
were all so worthwhile<br>
I always remember your smile</p>
<p>I always remember your smile</p>
<p>And it’s strange how for a moment<br>
the heavens were mine<br>
I always remember your smile</p>
<p>Each one has a journey<br>
that’s how it goes<br>
sometimes we’re together<br>
sometimes alone</p>
