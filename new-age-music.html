<h1>New Age, Celtic, ambient and ethereal music: artists like Enya</h1>

<p><strong><a title="News Age music bestsellers on Amazon.com"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Fmusic%2F36&tag=enylyrallenys-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">New Age music</a></strong>, often said to be Enya's musical genre, is a style originally associated with some New Age beliefs (but it's often not the case; Enya herself is catholic). It has its basis in the 1960s and is generally characterised as being primarily
instrumental and repetitively melodic in nature.</p>

<h3>New age</h3>

<p>New Age music is a genre that's all about creating a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. Think calming sounds, soothing melodies, and an overall feeling of tranquility.

<h4>Characteristics</h4>

<ul><li>Atmosphere is key: The main goal is to evoke a sense of serenity, often used for relaxation, meditation, yoga, or even just creating a calm environment at home.   </li><li>
Instrumentation: It can be quite diverse! You'll find acoustic instruments like piano, harp, and flute, alongside electronic instruments and nature sounds (think flowing water or birdsong).  </li>
<li>Melody and Harmony: Generally features gentle melodies and harmonies, avoiding complex structures or jarring sounds.  
Tempo: Usually slow and flowing, helping to create that relaxed vibe.  
</li></ul>


<h4>Purpose</h4>

<p>While it can simply be enjoyed for its beauty, New Age music often has a functional purpose:</p>

<ul><li>Stress reduction: Its calming nature can help lower anxiety and promote relaxation.</li>   

	<li>Mindfulness and meditation: It can help you focus your thoughts and achieve a meditative state.  </li>

		<li>Inspiration and creativity: Some find it sparks their imagination and helps them connect with their inner selves.</li></ul>

<h4>Key Artists</h4>

<p>Some of the most well-known New Age artists include:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3WvA96l"><strong>Enya</strong></a>: Known for her ethereal vocals and Celtic influences.  </li> 
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CkIvXm"><strong>Yanni</strong></a>: A pianist and composer known for his large-scale orchestral performances.  </li> 
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3PKZnK0"><strong>George Winston</strong></a>: A pianist known for his minimalist and melodic compositions.</li> 
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/40qM3Q4"><strong>Kitaro</strong></a>: A Japanese composer who blends electronic and acoustic instruments.</li> </ul>

<h3>Celtic music</h3>

<p>Celtic music today is a vibrant and evolving genre that honors its deep roots while embracing modern influences. It's more than just traditional jigs and reels - it's a dynamic blend of old and new, acoustic and electronic, local and global.  </p>


<h4>Traditional Music Still Thrives</h4>

    <ul><li>Preserving the heritage: Many musicians and bands dedicate themselves to keeping traditional forms alive, playing instruments like the fiddle, flute, uilleann pipes, harp, and bodhrán. </li>

    <li>Passing on the tradition: Festivals, sessions in pubs, and community gatherings ensure that these musical traditions are passed down through generations.</li></ul>

<h4>Fusion and Experimentation</h4>

    <p>Blending genres: Celtic music is increasingly fusing with other genres like rock, pop, electronic, world music, and even classical. This leads to exciting new sounds and collaborations.   </p>

	<h4>Contemporary Interpretations:</h4>

    <ul><li>Modernizing the sound: Artists like <a href="https://amzn.to/3WvA96l"><strong>Enya</strong></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3WuuNrW"><strong>Loreena McKennitt</strong></a> have achieved global success by incorporating Celtic elements into their contemporary styles, often with New Age or ethereal influences.   </li>

	<li>Expanding the audience: This approach introduces Celtic music to a broader audience who might not be familiar with the traditional forms.</li></ul>

		<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4hrI5gY"><strong>Clannad</strong></a> is a highly influential Irish musical group. They've been creating music since the 1970s and are known for their beautiful harmonies, traditional Irish influences, and Enya's early involvement (she's the younger sister of some of the band members!). Their music blends folk, traditional Irish, and even New Age elements.</li>
		<li><a href="https://amzn.to/42p24sn"><strong>The Chieftains:</strong></a>

	</ul>

<h3>Ethereal and ambiente music</h3>

<p>Both ethereal and ambient music aim to create immersive sonic experiences, but they have distinct characteristics:</p>

<h4>Ethereal Music</h4>

<ul><li>Dreamy and otherworldly: Imagine floating through clouds or exploring a fantastical realm. Ethereal music often evokes a sense of wonder, mystery, and transcendence.   </li>

	<li>Focus on atmosphere and texture: Melodies may be present but are often secondary to the overall mood and sonic landscape.</li>
		<li>Common elements: Reverb, delay, and other effects are used to create a spacious, atmospheric sound. Vocals are often layered and processed to sound angelic or otherworldly.  </li>
			<li>Examples: <a href="https://amzn.to/3WvA96l"><strong>Enya</strong></a>,
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4apTGuF"><strong>Cocteau Twins</strong></a>,
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4hl6JAh"><strong>Dead Can Dance</strong></a>,
				<a href="https://amzn.to/40qiMoC"><strong>Sigur Ros </strong></a>
		</li></ul>

		<h4>Ambient Music:</h4>

	<ul> <li>Calm and atmospheric: Think of a peaceful environment, like a quiet forest or a starry night sky. Ambient music is designed to create a calming and immersive atmosphere.   </li>

<li>Minimalism and subtlety: It often features slow tempos, long drones, and subtle shifts in sound. Melodies and rhythms are often understated or absent altogether.  </li>
<li>"Background" listening: While it can be enjoyed attentively, ambient music is often used to create a mood or enhance an environment without demanding focused attention.  </li>
<li>Examples: <a href="https://amzn.to/4jlewzn"><strong>Brian Eno</strong></a>,
	<a href="https://amzn.to/3E6UXus"><strong>Aphex Twin</strong></a>,
	<a href="https://amzn.to/4h2mU5d"><strong>Stars of the Lid</strong></a>,
