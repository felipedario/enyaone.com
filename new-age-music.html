<h1>New Age music: artists like Enya</h1>

<p><strong><a title="News Age music bestsellers on Amazon.com"

It has its basis in the 1960s and is generally characterised as being primarily
instrumental and repetitively melodic in nature.</p>

The group's repertoire ranges from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs (and Enya covers). To date, the group has released three albums: <em>Celtic Woman</em>, <em>Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration</em> and <em>Celtic Woman: A New Journey</em>, have undertaken a number of world tours, and which musician has released a solo paralell work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fexec%2Fobidos%2Fsearch-handle-url%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8%26search-type%3Dss%26index%3Dmusic%26field-artist%3DLoreena%2520McKennitt&tag=enylyrallenys-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325"><strong>Loreena McKennitt</strong></a>, born in February 17, 1957, is a Canadian singer, composer, harpist and pianist most famous for writing, recording and performing world music with New Age, Celtic and Middle Eastern themes. McKennitt is often compared to Enya, but McKennitt's music is more grounded in traditional and classical invocations, using literary works as sources of lyrics and springboards for interpretation such as "The Lady of Shalott" by Lord Tennyson.</p>

<p>Partly due to some artists' open affiliation with various New
Age beliefs, other artists and bands have specifically stated that they
do not consider their own music to be New Age, like Enya herself  - although their work may
be labelled that way by record labels, music retailers, or radio
broadcasters.</p>

<p>New Age music is largely typified by modal and consonant
harmonies, usually in conjunction with patches of sound effects or
nature samples. New Age music includes both electronic and instrumental
forms, frequently relying on sustained pads or long sequencer-based
runs; and acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano,
acoustic guitar and a wide variety of non-western acoutsitc
instruments. In many cases, high-quality samples are used instead of
natural acoustic instruments. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in
New Age music but as it has evolved vocals have become more common,
especially vocals featuring Sanskrit, Tibetan or Native
American-influenced chants, or lyrics based on mythology such as Celtic
legends.</p>

<p>During the 1980s, the term "New Age music" was introduced more
widely to the public by radio stations and then by music retailers and
some record companies, as a marketing tag applied to a variety of
non-mainstream instrumental music styles.</p>

<h3><a name="Definitions"></a>Definitions</h3>

<p>Some listeners consider New Age Music to be a branch of
Electronic Music. Others consider New Age Music to be defined more by
the feeling it produces rather than the devices used in its creation.
This is a subtle distinction but needs to be mentioned since while much
of the equipment used to produce New Age Music is electronic, or
computer-based, much New Age Music is also produced using purely
acoustic instruments.&nbsp;</p>


<p>There is a significant overlap of sectors of New Age Music,
Electronic Music (or Electronica), Ambient music, World music and in
that area there are at least three major groups of fans with varying
beliefs as to what New Age music is and which artists should be
classified as New Age artists. There are more than three viewpoints on
this but as a starting point for understanding the varieties, three
main points of view can be seen as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>that New Age music is a
branch of electronic music that
includes melodic, non-dance pieces with miscellaneous kinds of
arrangements. According to
this point of view, artists and bands like Michael Cretu's Enigma,
Enya, Clannad, Mike Oldfield, Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Yanni
all belong to the New Age category. This is somewhat problematic for
two reasons: first, artists like Enya and Vangelis stated that they do
not consider their music to be strictly <em>New
Age</em>, some of them perceiving "New Age music" as a genre necessarily
connected with the religious movement. Second, music by artists like&nbsp;Vangelis is stylistically very varied, with many
albums that cannot be classified as New Age,
and so it is unclear whether it would be fair to label the artists New
Age.</li>

<li>that New Age music is a branch of electronic music which
appears mostly on the meditation or relaxation CDs, which are
frequently seen in New Age bookshops and music stores.</li>

<li>that New Age music is electronic music that is melodic,
soothing and relatively simple sound-wise, with wide pads, gentle
melodies and long tracks. However, since many artists confine
themselves to creating only this specific kind of music, it is widely
used. According to it,&nbsp; Enya's music is probably not New Age, because it have
a very distinct style, different from generic melodic, soothing
electronic music.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Influences and themes</h3>

<p>From 1968 to 1973, German musicians such as Holger Czukay, Popol Vuh and Tangerine Dream
released a number of works featuring experimental sounds and textures
build with "electronics", synthesizers, acoustic and electric
instruments; their music, referred to as Cosmic music can be regarded
as Ambient or New Age, depending on point of view. Later Brian Eno
defined the styles and patterns of Ambient in a way that easily merged
and co-developed with the styles of many musicians such as Robert
Fripp, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Harold Budd, Cluster, Jah Wobble from late
1970s to today.</p>
<p>Other influences are early electronic music, classical music, ethnic
music and world music. The minimalism of Terry Riley and Steve Reich
(Indian influenced in the former case) can also be cited as an
influence, along with artists like Tony Conrad, LaMonte Young who
utilized drones since the early 1960s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Popular themes in New Age music include Space and the Cosmos,
Environment and Nature, Wellness in being, Harmony with one's self and
the world, Dreams or Dreaming and Journeys of the mind or spirit. Titles of New Age songs are frequently descriptive: examples
include "Principles of Lust" (Enigma), "Purple Dawn" (Anugama), "Shepherd
Moons" (Enya), "Straight' a Way To Orion" (Kitaro), "The Quiet Self"
(Gregorian), and "One Deep Breath" (Bradley Joseph).</p>
