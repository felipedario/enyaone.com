				<p>Enya's fifth studio album, <em>A Day Without Rain,</em> made its debut on November 20, 2000, under the WEA label. The album gained significant recognition, primarily due to the inclusion of the song <a href="#Only_Time">"Only Time,"</a> which served as the album's second single. "Only Time" quickly rose to prominence in 2000, capturing the hearts of listeners and achieving substantial success. However, its impact further intensified in 2001, when the song became intimately associated with the tragic events of the September 11 attacks. Through extensive use in various forms of media, "Only Time" became an anthem of resilience and hope during that challenging period. The album's enduring legacy stands as a testament to Enya's ability to create powerful and emotionally evocative music that resonates with audiences around the world.</p>

				<p> Following a promotional tour in support of her compilation album Paint the Sky with Stars (1997), Enya took a short break before she resumed writing and recording a new album in 1998 with her usual recording partners, <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan</a>. In a musical departure from her previous albums, Enya incorporates a string section which was not a conscious decision.</p>
				
				<p>Three versions of <em>A Day Without Rain</em> were released. In most
					countries, the album includes "The First of Autumn." The U.S. version
					lacks this track, while the Japanese version replaced "The First of
					Autumn" with "Isobella".</p>
				
				<p>It remains Enya's best selling album with an estimated 16 million copies sold worldwide. To promote the album, Enya made several interviews and televised performances, including the 2001 World Music Awards. In 2002, the album won Enya her third Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						A Day Without Rain is probably the most positive of all the albums in the sense that even reminiscences are looked upon lovingly rather than with only sadness, that you are able to enjoy life, that you are able to meet the day and not be afraid, but know where you are in it. Hence, the reference to the ocean and water as being one of separation has now become one that is less painful. Now is the time to see the beauty of life &mdash; in all its seasons. 
					</p>
					<em>Enya, Barnes &amp; Noble, 2000</em>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>Recording took place at Aigle Studio in the Ryans' home in Killiney, County Dublin. Enya felt the need to work at a more leisurely pace for <em>A Day Without Rain</em>. than working on her previous studio album, <em><a href="the-memory-of-trees.html">The Memory of Trees (1995)</a></em>, making a conscious effort to record for five days a week instead of seven, and take the weekends off. The reduction in her work schedule made her feel happier as a result.</p>
				
				<p>Enya produced <em>A Day Without Rain</em> in a similar way to her previous albums. She first spends time alone developing melodies and outlines of songs on the piano. These would then be presented to the Ryans; "I'm quite anxious at this point", she said, "because it really is an act of laying your soul bare". While Roma starts to write lyrics to the melodies, Enya and Nicky will work in the studio to develop them into completed arrangements. Working without a deadline from her record label or a set timeline, Enya felt the project was complete after two years, feeling it was time to "step out of the studio ... time for it to have its life out in the world".</p>

				<em>Roma Ryan</em>
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Lovers in the long grass
				
				<br />Look above them
				
				<br />Only they can see where the clouds are going
				
				<br />Only to discover
				
				<br />Dust and sunlight ever make the sky so blue
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Afternoon is hazy
				
				<br />River flowing
				
				<br />All around the sounds
				
				<br />Moving closer to them
				
				<br />Telling them the story
				
				<br />Told by Flora
				
				<br />Dreams they never knew
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Silver willows
				
				<br />Tears from Persia
				
				<br />Those who come from a far-off island
				
				<br />Winter Chanterelle lies under cover
				
				<br />Glory-of-the-sun in blue
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Some they know as passion
				
				<br />Some as freedom
				
				<br />Some they know as love
				
				<br />And the way it leaves them
				
				<br />Summer snowflake
				
				<br />For a season
				
				<br />When the sky above is blue
				
				<br />When the sky above is blue
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Lying in the long grass
				
				<br />Close beside her
				
				<br />Giving her the name of the one the moon loves
				
				<br />This will be the day she
				
				<br />Will remember
				
				<br />When she knew his heart was
				
				<br />Loving in the long grass
				
				<br />Close beside her
				
				<br />Whispering of love and the way it leaves them
				
				<br />Lying in the long grass
				
				<br />In the sunlight
				
				<br />They believe it's true love
				
				<br />And from all around them
				
				<br />Flora's secret
				
				<br />Telling them of love and the way it breathes
				
				<br />And
				
				<br />Looking up from eyes of amaranthine
				
				<br />They can see the sky is blue
				
				<br />Knowing that their love is true
				
				<br />dreams they never knew
				
				<br />And the sky above is blue

				<br />
				
				<br />Pilgrim, how you journey
				
				<br />On the road you chose
				
				<br />To find out where the winds die
				
				<br />And where the stories go.
				
				<br />All days come from one day
				
				<br />That much you must know,
				
				<br />You cannot change what's over
				
				<br />But only where you go.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />One way leads to diamonds,
				
				<br />One way leads to gold,
				
				<br />Another leads you only
				
				<br />To everything you're told.
				
				<br />In your heart you wonder
				
				<br />Which of these is true;
				
				<br />The road that leads to nowhere,
				
				<br />the road that leads to you.
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Will you find the answer
				
				<br />in all you say and do?
				
				<br />Will you find the answer
				
				<br />In you?
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Each heart is a pilgrim,
				
				<br />Each one wants to know
				
				<br />The reason why the winds die
				
				<br />And where the stories go.
				
				<br />Pilgrim, in your journey
				
				<br />You may travel far,
				
				<br />For pilgrim it's a long way
				
				<br />To find out who you are...
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Pilgrim, it's a long way
				
				<br />To find out who you are...
				
				<br />

				<br />My, oh my!
				
				<br />She was aiming too high.
				
				<br />He says Adi&oacute;s, says Adi&oacute;s,<br />And now you know why
				
				<br />There's no moon in her sky
				
				<br />- he says Adi&oacute;s, says Adi&oacute;s, Goodbye.<br />- he says Adi&oacute;s, says Adi&oacute;s, Goodbye.<br />
				
				<br />No Goodbyes
				
				<br />For love brightens their eyes
				
				<br />Don't say Adi&oacute;s, say Adi&oacute;s,<br />And do you know why
				
				<br />There's a love that won't die?
				
				<br />- don't say Adi&oacute;s, say Adi&oacute;s, Goodbye.<br />

				<em>Roma Ryan</em>
				
				<br />
				
				<br />Lazy old day
				
				<br />Rolling away
				
				<br />Dreaming the day away
				
				<br />Don't want to go
				
				<br />Now that I'm in the flow
				
				<br />Crazy amazing day
				
				<br />
				
				<br />One red balloon
				
				<br />Floats to the moon
				
				<br />Just let it fly away
				
				<br />I only know
				
				<br />That I'm longing to go
				
				<br />Back to my lazy day
				
				<br />
				
				<br />And how it sings and how it sighs
				
				<br />And how it never stays
				
				<br />And how it rings and how it cries
				
				<br />And how it sails away... away... away....

				<h3><a name="linearnotes"></a>Linear notes</h3>
				
				<p>From <em>Only Time: The Colletion</em>. More information on <a href="http://enya.sk/only-time-liner-notes/">Enya.sk page on that colletion</a>.</p>
				
				<h4>Isobella</h4>
				
				<p>A song for a child. A spirit-child. One whom both Enya and
					myself experienced yet know nothing about. A truly beautiful and
					peaceful child. We called the little spirit child Isobella and this
					song is for her.</p>
				
				<h4>Only Time</h4>
				
				<p>Who knows the way of love? Only time�</p>
				
				<h4>A Day Without Rain</h4>
				
				<p><em>"�No-one remembers as I do
					<br>how each word of love you gave was true.
					
					<br>So often do I dream of you
					
					<br>
					
					so my heart is not alone.</em></p>
				
				<p><em>Can dreams be found
					<br>when the sun comes again?
					
					<br>Tears still fall down
					
					<br>
					in a day without rain�"</em></p>
				
				<p>Originally we thought this track to be a song and began writing
					lyrics. However as work on the music progressed it became clear
					that it wanted to be an instrumental. The lyrics, although
					incomplete, are given here. We did however keep one of the lines as
					the title of the track.</p>
				
				<h4>Wild Child</h4>
				
				<p>The day is a wild child. It is unpredictable, it is reckless, it
					offers you no security, it promises nothing. It is what you make
					it. So make it good.</p>
				
				<h4>Flora's Secret</h4>
				
				<p>Tells of lovers lying in the long grass. Perhaps the girl is
					called Flora. Perhaps the "flora" in the song are the
					flowers they are surrounded by. Perhaps it is about the Goddess of
					flowers, Flora.</p>
				
				<p>The Song was inspired by the various legends from classical
					mythology given to flowers. The "tears from Persia" are
					the Persian Iris. They are the tears of the Mourning Iris taken
					from the legend of Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, the Goddess
					of the Corn. Persephone was abducted by Hades, and was made to
					spend six months of each year in the underworld with him (hence
					winter) and the other six months on earth (hence summer). Ah, but
					who is the one the moon loves?</p>
				
				<h4>Fallen Embers</h4>
				
				<p>The memory of a special time with the one you love and a
					reflection of the loss of that love. Yet it is reminiscence filled
					with the tenderness of that love, as much as with the saddness of
					its loss. It is a celebration of that special time, and a lament
					that it is over.</p>
				
				<h4>Tempus Vernum</h4>
				
				<p>Our lives are entwined with each other and with everything in
					nature. Yet, although we are part of the cycle of life, we should
					remember that the earth can begin again - without us.
					Therefore�</p>
				
				<h4>Deora ar mo Chro�</h4>
				
				<p>This song continues the theme of Tempus Vernum, a reflection on
					the beauty of mother earth, and how, after we journey through our
					days with her, we move beyond. And still the earth sings�</p>
				
				<h4>One by One</h4>
				
				<p>Four tales from under the Cherry tree. Four tales, four seasons,
					four loves. Each tale tells a different story, each season
					has its own time, each love ends in a different way. One by one the
					tales of love are told, and one by one the pages upon which they
					are written fall as the leaves fall.</p>
				
				<h4>The First of Autumn</h4>
				
				<p>(Haiku) <em>
					<br>Love is like the leaves;
					
					<br>some ever green, some fall on
					
					<br>
					the first of autumn.</em></p>
				
				<p>Whilst writing poetry relating to the seasons, I had included
					some Haiku, the Japanese verse form, and from one of these came the
					idea for "the First of Autumn". The Haiku is printed here
					for the first time.</p>
				
				<h4>Lazy Days</h4>
				
				<p>In the helter skelter of life it is good for the heart and the
					soul to have a lazy day. One where you make time to dream, to
					consider, to meditate, to reflect. When simply to be is enough.
					When we do not worry about the moments that cause us such concern
					and distress, but enjoy the moment as it is. Whether summer or
					winter, whether watching the corn moving in the wind, or a single
					red balloon floating skywards.</p>
