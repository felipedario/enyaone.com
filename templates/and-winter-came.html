<p>Enya's album titled 	<strong><em>And Winter Came...</em></strong>emerged on the music scene in 2008, with its UK release on November 10th and US release on November 11th. The collection of songs primarily embraces a Christmas or Winter theme, immersing listeners in a seasonal ambiance. The album made its mark on the UK charts, peaking at #6 on November 16, 2008, reflecting its popularity among listeners. Since its initial release, <em>And Winter Came...</em> has garnered significant commercial success, surpassing 2,100,000 copies sold. This achievement further solidifies Enya's enduring presence in the music industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/48dzSaQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stream or download Enya songs</a></p>

<p>Enya's album comprises a collection of twelve tracks, including ten original English compositions. Among them, "Oiche Chiuin" stands out, sung in Gaelic, and a rendition of "Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel" performed in Latin. Notably, "Oiche Chiuin" presents a unique occurrence where Enya re-recorded a previously released track, originally unveiled in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>Diverging from the pattern of previous Enya albums, which often saw the release of CD singles accompanied by bonus tracks, it seems that there are no plans for physical media singles from this album. Instead, the focus lies on digital downloads.</p>

	<p>Enya, expressing her thoughts on her website, shared her long-standing desire to create a Christmas album. However, during the recording process,  she "didn't feel it was right to impose a Christmas theme on certain  songs", leading to a more nuanced approach in crafting this collection.</p>

<p><a href="{{ url_for('roma_ryan_nicky') }}">Nicky Ryan</a>, her producer since <a href="{{ url_for('album_enya') }}">the first album</a>, adds that they "started out writing for a
Christmas album, but it has evolved into more an Enya album based in a
winter landscape where Christmas arrives here and there, but it would be wrong to call it an Enya Christmas album."</p>

</iframe>

<p><a href="{{ url_for('roma_ryan_nicky') }}">Roma Ryan</a>, Enya's lyricist, also talks
about the title and the &ldquo;sense of possibility that Christmas
brings&rdquo;: &ldquo;some
people see it <em>[the winter]</em> as an ending, with a
whole story before it, but
I see it very much as a new beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The song "Trains and Winter Rains", which premiered in UK radios on September 29, will be released as the album first single in November 10th too. "This track is my personal choice for the first single also" Enya says "I particularly enjoyed our percussion arrangement in this song." It's also described by Roma as a "journey from home that everyone must make when they start to get too comfortable." It features "Agnus Dei", a Christian verse commonly heard in churches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;White is in the Winter Night&rdquo;, described
by Nicky Ryan as &ldquo;the
kind of song you could hear at the Proms with everyone joining in, it
has that kind of Christmassy vibe&rdquo;, is the album second single, released for dowload only in November 4th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&rdquo; is a version of the Latin
carol &ldquo;Veni Veni&rdquo;, rumored
to be sung in Latin. &ldquo;O&iacute;che
Ch&iacute;un (Chorale)&rdquo; was re-recorded after 20 years: Enya says that &ldquo;It was exciting to re-live &lsquo;Silent
Night&rsquo; (...) It is re-released every year in America and it was so nice to go back and do something different with it.&rdquo; The new
rendering incorporates
what Nicky describes as the &ldquo;choir of one&rdquo;,
multi-layering Enya vocals. &ldquo;I
enjoy the process, I love the excitement of not knowing if it will
work,&rdquo; admits Enya.</p>

<p>"Midnight Blue", instrumental b-side from "Wild Child" single, has been reworked as "Stars and Midnight Blue", with added vocals. The song "And Winter Came" is an instrumental meant for reflection.</p>

<p>The last recorded song for the album, &ldquo;My! My! Time Flies!&rdquo;, is a tribute to the late Irish guitarist Jimmy Faulkner. The song involves a slight departure for Enya featuring guitar solos as well as references to The Beatles, Elvis and B.B King. Dubliner Pat Farrell is the featured guitarist on the track, which insiders are forecasting will be the third single, with a likely release date in the new year.</p>

<p>The bonus track <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KPYNW0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001KPYNW0&linkCode=as2&tag=enylyrallenys-20&linkId=PRFYST3ZTYISYVUS">"Miraculum" is available as an Amazon.com mp3 download</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="JOTF"></a>Journey of the Angels lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

Somewhere in a winter night<br />
The angels begin their flight<br />
Dark skies with miles to go<br />
No footsteps to be lost in snow<br /><br />

They fly to you, Oh! newborn king<br />
They fly to you, oh! angels sing<br />
one is sorrow<br />
one is peace<br />
one will come<br />
to give you sleep<br />
one is comfort<br />
one is grief<br />
one will take<br />
the tears you weep<br /><br />

New star in a midnight sky<br />
In Heaven all the angels cry<br />
Soft wings so true<br />
And all things they will give to you<br /><br />

Somewhere in a winter night<br />
The angels begin their flight<br />
Tonight all sing<br />
Oh angels, a newborn king<br />
Tonight all sing<br />
Oh! Angels, a newborn king.<br /><br />

<h4><a name="WIITWN"></a>White is in the Winter Night lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

Have you seen the mistletoe?<br />
It fills the night with kisses.<br />
Have you seen the bright blue star?<br />
It fills your heart with wishes.<br />
Have you seen the candlelight?<br />
It shines from every window.<br />
Have you seen the moon above?<br />
It lights the sky in silver.<br /><br />

Green is in the mistletoe and red is in the holly.<br />
Silver in the stars above that shine on everybody.<br />
Gold is in the candlelight and crimson in the embers.<br />
White is in the winter night that everyone remembers.<br /><br />

Have you heard the boys outside<br />
when all the girls are skating?<br />
Have you heard their sweethearts cry<br />
for all this time theyï¿½re waiting?<br /><br />

Green is in the mistletoe and red is in the holly.<br />
Silver in the stars above that shine on everybody.<br />
Gold is in the candlelight and crimson in the embers.<br />
White is in the winter night that everyone remembers.<br /><br />

Have you seen the children playing?<br />
Tiny hands are frozen!<br />
Have you seen them hurry home<br />
when suddenly its snowing?<br />
Green is in the mistletoe and red is in the holly.<br />
Silver in the stars above that shine on everybody.<br />
Gold is in the candlelight and crimson in the embers.<br />
White is in the winter night that everyone remembers.<br /><br />

Have you heard that bells are ringing,<br />
ringing out their story?<br />
Have you heard the choir singing,<br />
Glory! Glory! Glory!<br /><br />

O come, O come Emmanuel<br />
To free your captive Israel<br />
That mourns in lonely exile here<br />
Until the Son of God appear.<br />
Rejoice! Rejoice! O Israel!<br />
To you shall come Emmanuel!<br /><br />

Veni, veni Emmanuel;<br />
Captivum solve Israel,<br />

<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

(Agnus Dei)<br />

<br />
City streets passing by<br />
Underneath stormy skies<br />
<br />
Neon signs in the night<br />
Red and blue city lights<br />
Cargo trains rolling by<br />
Once again someone cries<br />
<br />
Trains and winter rains<br />

No going back no going home<br />
Trains across the plains<br />
And in the sky a star alone<br />
<br />
Everytime it's the same<br />
One more night one more train<br />
Everywhere empty roads<br />
Where they go no one knows<br />
<br />
Trains and winter rains<br />

No going back no going home<br />
Trains across the plains<br />
And in the sky a star alone<br />
<br />
Da, da, da, da... (extended)<br />
<br />
Trains and winter rains<br />
No going back no going home<br />
Trains across the plains<br />
And in the sky a star alone<br />

<br />
Trains and winter rains<br />
No going back no going home<br />
Trains across the plains<br />
And in the sky a star alone<br />

<h4><a name="DAMP"></a>Dreams are More Precious lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

Come! See! High above.<br />
Come! See! High in the heavens<br />
a new star shining bright;<br />
out of the darkness comes a light.<br /><br />

Come! Hear midnight chimes.<br />
Come! Hear bells that are ringing<br />
and from some distant shore<br />
sounds of a journey echo on.<br /><br />

This is the night,<br />
they say,<br />
everyone wants a dream.<br />
This is the night,<br />
they say,<br />
nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />

Come! Sleep! Close your eyes.<br />
Come! Sleep! Give me your sorrow<br />
and Iï¿½ll keep watch for you<br />
until the dawn is breaking through,<br />
until the morning wakens you.<br /><br />

Come! Dream through the night.<br />
Come! Dream, and then tomorrow<br />
youï¿½ll see your heart will know<br />
dreams are more precious than gold.<br />
Dreams are more precious than gold.<br />
Dreams are more precious than gold.<br /><br />

<h4><a name="LABM"></a>Last Time by Moonlight lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

The winter sky above us<br />
was shining in moonlight,<br />
And everywhere around us<br />
the silence of midnight.<br />
And we had gathered snowflakes;<br />
Remember the soft light<br />
of starlight on snow.<br /><br />

Oooh, remember this,<br />
for no-one knows<br />
the way love goes.<br />
Oooh, remember this,<br />
for no-one knows<br />
the way life goes.<br /><br />

We walked the road together<br />
one last time by moonlight,<br />
as underneath the heavens<br />
the slow chimes at midnight,<br />
but nothing is forever<br />
not even the starlight<br />
at midnight not even<br />
the moonlight...<br /><br />

Oooh, remember this,<br />
for no-one knows<br />
the way love goes.<br />
Oooh, remember this,<br />
for no-one knows<br />
the way life goes.<br /><br />

<h4><a name="OTS"></a>One Toy Soldier lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

One toy soldier stands alone<br />
With his drum down by his side<br />
One toy soldier on his own<br />
With his drum to keep the time<br /><br />

He keeps the beat, a marching beat<br />
He keeps the beat so true<br />
Heï¿½s one small toy for one small boy<br />
But his heart is oh, so blue<br /><br />

Who can mend my broken drum?<br />
Will it be as good as new?<br />
I must play when morning comes<br />
If I donï¿½t what shall I do?<br /><br />

He keeps the beat, a marching beat<br />
He keeps the beat inside<br />
While children sleep in dreams so deep<br />
Thereï¿½s a secret he must hide<br /><br />

For he keeps the beat, a marching beat<br />
He keeps the beat so true<br />
He wants to sing and hopes to bring<br />
Happy Christmas day to you<br /><br />

He keeps the beat, a marching beat<br />
He keeps the beat inside<br />
Someone has come to mend his drum<br />
Now his heart lights up with pride!<br /><br />

So he keeps the beat, a marching beat<br />
He keeps the beat so true<br />
When morning comes he plays his drum<br />
Happy Christmas Day to you!<br />
Happy Christmas Day to you!<br />
Happy Christmas Day to you!<br />
Happy Christmas Day to you!<br /><br />

<h4><a name="SAMB"></a>Stars and Midnight Blue lyrics</h4>
<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

Memories we share together<br />
Moments no-one else can know<br />
I will keep them close to me<br />
Never let them go<br /><br />

Once you filled my hands with roses<br />
Then you gave your heart to me<br />
When a kiss had followed this<br />
Love was meant to be<br /><br />

Time goes by and the snow<br />
is drifting slowly in the sky<br />
Cold, cold night as you lie beside me<br />
Iï¿½ve can hear your heart beat<br /><br />

You have lost yourself in dreaming<br />
I have lost myself in you<br />
Now we lie beneath the sky<br />
Stars and midnight blue<br />
Stars and midnight blue<br /><br />

<em>Roma Ryan</em><br /><br />

When tears are in your eyes,<br />
Itï¿½s time to look inside:<br />
Your heart can find another way.<br /><br />

Believe in what I say:<br />
Donï¿½t throw this time away.<br />
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day.<br />
Christmas Day.<br /><br />

So let the shadows go<br />
And drift away like snow.<br />
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day.<br />
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day.<br />
Christmas day.<br /><br />

So dream until the night<br />
Becomes the morning light.<br />
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day.<br />
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day.<br /><br />

One step and we're on the moon,<br />

My! My! Time flies!<br />
Maybe we could be there soon,<br />
a one-way ticket to Mars.<br /><br />

My! My! Time flies!<br />

an apple falls on his head.<br />
My! My! Time flies!<br />
A man wrote a symphony, it's 1812.<br /><br />

Four guys across Abbey Road,<br />
one forgot to wear shoes.<br />
My! My! Time flies!<br />
A rap on a rhapsody,<br />
a king who's still in the news,<br />
a king to sing you the blues.<br /><br />

<strong><em>Translation</em></strong><br /><br />
<strong>Miracle</strong><br />

Once we were singing<br />
the story of a great journey<br />
the moonlight on water,<br />
the shores, a star, the sky.<br />
To set sail,<br />
a wonderful thing.<br />
To sail away. Itï¿½s true.<br />
Once, the open sea<br />
under the evening star.<br />
And so we sailed away.<br /><br />

In this day<br />
we sing of the white snow<br />
the moonlight on ice,<br />
a tear and rain.<br />
To set sail,<br />
a wonderful thing.<br />
To sail away. Itï¿½s true.<br />
Wayfarers<br />
see the sky,<br />
the ocean and the earth.<br /><br />

To set sail,<br />
a wonderful thing.<br />
To sail away. Itï¿½s true.<br />
Go! Go!<br />
The sea, the sea<br />
under the evening star.<br /><br />

To set sail,<br />
a wonderful thing.<br />
To sail away. Itï¿½s true.<br />
For already it is the twentieth year!<br />
Oh, time is a dream!<br /><br />

To set sail,<br />
a wonderful thing.<br />
To sail away. Itï¿½s true.<br />
And perhaps<br />
tomorrow<br />
we will sail away. Sail away.<br /><br />
