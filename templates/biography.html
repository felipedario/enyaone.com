<h3 id="faq">A few frequently asked questions and personal life details</h3>

<h4>Is Enya married? Who is Enya's husband? </h4>
<p>Enya is not married and does not have a husband. She has never been married. While she sometimes wears rings,  these are not indicative of her marital status. The rings she wears hold sentimental value, having belonged to her late grandmother.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I have never come close to being married or engaged. I was with someone eight years ago when I questioned whether I wanted the pressure of being married or having children. I always felt that if pregnancy was to happen, it would happen; if it didn't, it didn't. ... I have security, I don't need a man in my life. I don't have pets, I have two guard dogs; and I don't do my own shopping; it's a security thing....The downside of success is stalkers. I have had death threats from people with fixations who need help.</p>

<h4>What's Enya net worth?</h4>
<p>Enya's net worth is estimated to be around Â£91 million (or roughly $119 million USD) according to the Sunday Times Rich List in 2016.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is an estimate. Net worth figures for celebrities can vary depending on the source and how it's calculated. Her wealth comes primarily from music. Enya has sold over 75 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.</li>
    <li>She lives a private life. Enya is known for being reclusive, so she doesn't flaunt her wealth and likely has investments we don't know about.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where does Enya live? Does Enya lives alone in a castle with her cats?</h4>
<p>In 1997, Enya bought a small Victorian castle located in Killiney, Dublin. The castle, which was built in 1840 by Robert Warren, was originally named "Victoria Castle" after Queen Victoria. Enya renamed it "Manderley Castle". The name comes from the book <em>Rebecca</em> by Daphne du Maurier, whose story is set in Manderley. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manderley_Castle">More in Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I live in Victorian Gothic castle in Killiney that I was so bold as to rename Manderley, because Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca is one of my favourite books. ... People have this image of me as an ethereal Lady of Shalott, floating across the battlements, but it's a very small castle as castles go  &mdash; with no big ballrooms... I don't write my music in my home, only in the studio; I want as normal life as possible at home, with dinner parties and entertaining.</p>
	<p>I don't have pets, I have two guard dogs; and I don't do my own shopping; it's a security thing.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Is Enya still alive? Where is Enya now?</h4>
<p>Yes, Enya is still alive. She is 63 years old.</p>
<p>As for where she is now, the most recent information I have is that she resides in Manderley Castle in Killiney, County Dublin, Ireland. We do not have access to real-time information on her current whereabouts, as she is a very private person.</p>

<h4>How old is Enya?</h4>
<p>Enya was born on May 17, 1961. That makes her currently 63 years old.</p>

<h4>Where is Enya from? Is she Irish?</h4>
<p>Enya is from Gweedore, County Donegal, Ireland.</p>
<p>It's a small village in the northwest of Ireland, in a region known as a Gaeltacht, where Irish Gaelic is the primary language. This upbringing had a significant influence on her music, which often incorporates elements of Celtic and Irish folk traditions </p>

<h4>What is Enya's musical genre? What's her type of music?</h4>
<p>Numerous critics and reviewers classify Enya's albums as <a href="{{ url_for('new_age_music') }}">new age music</a> and she has won four Grammy Awards in the category. However, Enya does not classify her music as part of the genre. When asked what genre she would classify her music, her reply was "Enya".</p>
<p><a href="{{ url_for('roma_ryan_nicky') }}">Nicky Ryan</a> commented on the new age comments: "Initially it was fine, but it's really not new age. Enya plays a whole lot of instruments, not just keyboards. Her melodies are strong and she sings a lot. So I can't see a comparison."</p>

<h4>Does Enya do shows or concert tours? Are there any planned appearances on TV, signing sessions...</h4>
<p>Despite promoting her albums and making a few TV appearances, Enya hasn't toured since her days with Clannad in the 1980s. While she's hinted at touring in interviews, fans likely won't see a live Enya experience anytime soon. Enya does make appearances on TV and radio: <a href="{{ url_for('videos') }}">check this live performances compilation</a>.</p> {# TODO: Check if enya-live-video.html is the correct target, might be a named anchor #}

<h4>Is Enya a religious person?</h4>
<p>Enya has been described as "spiritual but not religious."</p>
<p>Enya grew up in a Catholic household in Ireland, which likely influenced her cultural background. Her music often features themes that resonate with spirituality, with some songs containing Christian references.  Enya herself hasn't explicitly identified as a Christian artist.</p>
<p>Overall, her music seems to connect with people of various faiths due to its spiritual undertones, while remaining open to broader interpretations.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>For me, I've derived from religion ... what... I enjoy ... and it's to go to church, but usually ... when there's nobody else there. I just love that moment, ah, to just sit there. It's very peaceful, very calm, and very therapeutic, and it's ... wonderful.</p>

<h3>Enya's biography</h3>
<p>Enya's musical journey began in Gweedore, County Donegal, Ireland. Immersed in the rich cultural heritage of this Irish-speaking region, she was born into a musical family. This environment fostered her talent, and in 1980, she joined her family's band, <a href="{{ url_for('enya_clannad') }}">Clannad</a>. With Clannad, she showcased her skills on keyboards and provided backing vocals. However, by 1982, Enya decided to forge her own path as a solo artist. Partnering with Clannad's manager and producer, Nicky Ryan, and enlisting the lyrical talents of his wife, Roma Ryan, Enya embarked on a successful solo career.</p>
<p>Over four years, Enya developed a signature style using layered vocals and keyboards. Her music seamlessly blended new age, Celtic, classical, and folk influences, creating a unique and captivating sound. This artistic exploration extended to language, with Enya recording songs in ten languages.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>For me this career and that I am privileged to do a job I love to do, means really, really much. I would never change any moment from my life. When making music I sink myself into the process as deeply as I can and forget all of the success.</p>

<p>Enya's first projects as a solo artist included soundtrack work for <a href="{{ url_for('other_songs') }}"><em>The Frog Prince</em></a> (1984) {# TODO: Check if enya-other.html is the correct link target or if a specific anchor is needed #} and the 1987 BBC documentary series <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_celts') }}"><em>The Celts</em></a>, which was released as her debut album, <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_celts') }}"><em>Enya</em></a> (1987). She signed with Warner Music UK, which granted her artistic freedom and minimal interference from the label. The commercial and critical success of <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}"><em>Watermark</em></a> (1988) propelled her to worldwide fame, helped by the international top-10 hit single "Orinoco Flow". This was followed by the multi-million selling albums <a href="{{ url_for('album_shepherd_moons') }}"><em>Shepherd Moons</em></a> (1991), <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_memory_of_trees') }}"><em>The Memory of Trees</em></a> (1995) and <a href="{{ url_for('album_a_day_without_rain') }}"><em>A Day Without Rain</em></a> (2000). Sales of the latter and its lead single, "Only Time", surged in the United States following its use in the media coverage of the September 11 attacks. Following <a href="{{ url_for('album_amarantine') }}"><em>Amarantine</em></a> (2005) and <a href="{{ url_for('album_and_winter_came') }}"><em>And Winter Came...</em></a> (2008), Enya took an extended break from music; she returned in 2012 and released <a href="{{ url_for('album_dark_sky_island') }}"><em>Dark Sky Island</em></a> (2015).</p>

<p><strong>Enya is known for her privacy and has never undertaken a concert tour.</strong> She is Ireland's bestselling solo artist overall, and bestselling act behind U2, with a discography that has sold 26.5 million certified albums in the United States and an estimated 80 million records worldwide, making her one of the bestselling music artists of all time. <a href="{{ url_for('album_a_day_without_rain') }}"><em>A Day Without Rain</em></a> (2000) remains the bestselling new-age album, with an estimated 16 million copies sold worldwide. Enya has won awards including seven World Music Awards, four Grammy Awards for Best New Age Album, and an Ivor Novello Award. She was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for "<a href="{{ url_for('the_lord_of_the_rings') }}">May It Be</a>", written for <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em> (2001).</p> {# TODO: Check if the_lord_of_the_rings.html is the correct target, might be other_songs.html with an anchor #}

<blockquote>
	<p>Enya was born Eithne Ni Bhraonain in Co. Donegal, Ireland. Enya studied classical music at college and under private tuition. On leaving college she was asked by Producer Nicky Ryan to join her siblings in their family band. She did so for a short time, but found it too restrictive musically, and so in 1982 she joined Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan in a creative and business partnership. Enya's first commission was to write a score for Sir David Puttnam for his film "The Frog Prince". Then, the triumvirate secured the soundtrack to the BBC documentary series 'The Celts'. Enya was then signed up by Warner Music and all three by EMI Music Publishing.</p>
	<p>The first album of this contract was "Watermark" with the hit single "Orinoco Flow". This was followed by "Shepherd Moons" "The memory of trees" "Paint the sky with Stars" "A day without rain" which produced the single 'Only Time' "Amarantine" and for "Lord of the Rings; the fellowship of the Ring" the songs "Aniron" and "May it be". Enya, Nicky and Roma were nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for an Academy Award for the song "May it be" and have also merited many other nominations and awards, including the Ivor Novello for International Achievement. The latest honours bestowed on Enya were two Honorary Degrees, the University of Galway honoured her with Doctor of Music and the University of Ulster honoured Enya with Doctor of Letters.</p>

<h3><a name="Musical_upbringing_and_Clannad"></a>Musical upbringing and Clannad</h3>
<p>Eithne Patricia N&iacute; Bhraon&aacute;in was born in Gweedore, County Donegal, in Ireland in 1961 to a musical family, the fifth of nine children. Enya's musical path was practically preordained. Her grandparents performed in a band throughout Ireland, laying the groundwork for her artistic heritage. Her father led his own band, the Slieve Foy Band, before venturing into the hospitality industry with a pub. Music remained a constant, as Enya's mother actively played and even went on to teach music at the Gweedore Comprehensive School. The artistic influence didn't stop there â several of Enya's siblings formed their own band, An Clann As Dobhar, in 1968.  This rich musical environment undoubtedly nurtured Enya's talent and passion for music. They renamed the band <a href="{{ url_for('enya_clannad') }}">Clannad</a>, which means "family", in the 1970s.</p>
<p>In 1980, Enya worked with Clannad, then composed of her siblings M&aacute;ire (Moya), P&oacute;l, and Ciar&aacute;n and twin uncles Noel and Padraig Duggan. Enya played the keyboard and provided backing vocals on their albums Crann &Uacute;ll (1980) and Fuaim (1981), although she was never officially a member of the group. Enya struck out on her own in 1982, just before Clannad's hit "Theme From Harry's Game." She teamed up with producer and manager Nicky Ryan to forge a solo career.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I joined my family's band, Clannad, as a teenager in 1980 to sing harmonies and play keyboards, but it wasn't musically challenging for me; I felt like an outsider. ... My split from Clannad two years later caused a conflict of loyalty for a time, because I went off with their manager Nicky Ryan, who had asked me to join Clannad in the first place.</p>

    </p>
</div>

<p>Enya recorded two solo instrumental songs called "An Ghaoth &Oacute;n Ghrian" ("The Solar Wind") and <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}#Miss_Claire_Remembers">"Miss Clare Remembers"</a> that were released on the 1983 demo tape <em>Touch Travel</em>. She was first credited as <em>Enya</em> (as opposed to <em>Eithne</em>) for writing some of the music for the 1984 movie <em>The Frog Prince</em>, which was released on a soundtrack album of the same title. Another early appearance on record followed in 1987, where Enya provided spoken vocals on Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor's debut album, <em>The Lion and the Cobra</em>. The title of the album is a partial English translation of Enya's Gaelic reading of Psalms 91:11-13 on the song "Never Get Old".</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Enya is more than just me. It's also Nicky, who arranges my melodies, and his wife Roma, who writes the lyrics. They believed in my music from day one</p>
	<em>Enya</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Enya was contracted to provide music for the soundtrack of the 1986 <a href="{{ url_for('the_celts_documentary') }}">BBC television documentary <em>The Celts</em></a>. The music she produced was featured on her first solo album, <a href="{{ url_for('album_enya') }}"><em>Enya</em> (1987)</a>, but it attracted little attention at the time.</p>

<h3><a name="International_Breakthrough"></a>International breakthrough</h3>
<p>Enya achieved a breakthrough in her career in 1988 with the album <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}"><em>Watermark</em></a>, which featured the hit song <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}#Orinoco_Flow">"Orinoco Flow" (sometimes known as "Sail Away")</a>. "Orinoco Flow" topped the charts in the United Kingdom, and the album sold eight million copies.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The success of Watermark surprised me. I never thought of music as something commercial; it was something very personal to me... The writing of a melody is an emotional moment; success doesn't make it easy.</p>
	<em>Enya</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Three years later, she followed with another hit album, <a href="{{ url_for('album_shepherd_moons') }}"><em>Shepherd Moons</em></a>, which sold ten million copies and earned Enya her first Grammy Award. The songs <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}#On_Your_Shore">"On Your Shore"</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}#Exile">"Exile"</a> (from <em>Watermark</em>) and <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_celts') }}#Epona">"Epona"</a> (from <em>Enya</em>) were featured in the 1991 film <em>L.A. Story</em>. <a href="{{ url_for('album_shepherd_moons') }}#Ebud%E6">"Ebudae"</a> was also featured on the soundtrack to the Robin Williams film <em>Toys</em>, while the 1990 film <em>Green Card</em> had <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}#River">"River"</a>, <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}#Watermark">"Watermark"</a>, and <a href="{{ url_for('album_watermark') }}#Storms_In_Africa">"Storms In Africa"</a>. <a href="{{ url_for('other_songs') }}#Book_Of_Days_English_Lyric">"Book Of Days"</a> was featured prominently in the movie <em>Far and Away</em>, featuring Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise.</p> {# TODO: Check other_songs.html for anchor #}
<p>In 1992 a remastered version of the <em>Enya</em> album was released, called <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_celts') }}"><em>The Celts</em></a> and including a longer, modified version of <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_celts') }}#Portrait_Out_Of_The_Blue">"Portrait (Out of the Blue)"</a>. Four years after <em>Shepherd Moons</em>, she released the Grammy-winning <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_memory_of_trees') }}"><em>The Memory of Trees</em> (1995)</a>.</p>
<p>In 1997, Enya released her greatest hits collection, <a href="{{ url_for('album_paint_the_sky_with_stars') }}"><em>Paint The Sky With Stars: The Best of Enya</em></a>, which featured two new songs: <a href="{{ url_for('album_paint_the_sky_with_stars') }}#Paint_the_Sky_with_Stars">"Paint the Sky With Stars"</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('album_paint_the_sky_with_stars') }}#Only_If...">"Only If..."</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Return_and_A_Day_Without_Rain"></a>Return and&nbsp;<em>A Day Without Rain</em></h3>
<p>Following a five-year break, she released the Grammy winning <a href="{{ url_for('album_a_day_without_rain') }}"><em>A Day Without Rain</em></a> in 2000. The album is Enya's most successful to date, peaking at #2 on the US Billboard Album charts. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, her song <a href="{{ url_for('album_a_day_without_rain') }}#Only_Time">"Only Time"</a> (from <em>A Day Without Rain</em>) was used as a backdrop in many radio and TV reports about the attacks. She initially frowned upon this use, especially when many bootlegged versions of "Only Time" mixed with sound effects from the attack began to appear.</p>
<p>"Only Time" surged in popularity after 9/11, with Enya even releasing a charity version. However, some fans found this association unwelcome. For example, during a 2002 CNN appearance, images of war clashed with her performance of "<a href="{{ url_for('other_songs') }}#May_It_Be">May It Be</a>", a song with little war connection, featured in <a href="{{ url_for('the_lord_of_the_rings') }}"><em>The Lord Of The Ring: The Fellowship Of The Ring</em></a> movie soundtrack. This highlights the complex relationship between music and its interpretation.</p> {# TODO: Check other_songs.html and the_lord_of_the_rings.html for anchors/correct pages #}
<blockquote>
	<p>There is no formula to it because writing every song, for me, is a little journey. The first note has to lift you and make you go, 'What's this?' You play C, but why is it that one day it leads to G and it didn't yesterday? I don't know. It's everything. It's the walk you take in the morning, it's the night before, the meeting with people, landscapes, the chats, all of that evolves in some way into melody, but I'm not sure how it's going to happen. I'm dealing with the unknown all the time and that is exciting.</p>
	<em>Enya</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Enya is self-admittedly a slow worker when it comes to composing music, therefore fans have had to wait as long as five years between albums. In September 2004, a new song, set to words from a Japanese poem Roma Ryan had written and called <a href="{{ url_for('album_amarantine') }}#Sumiregusa_Wild_Violet">"Sumiregusa" ("Wild Violet")</a> was unveiled in Japan as part of an advertising campaign for Panasonic. In announcing the new recording, Warner Music Japan stated that Enya's next album was scheduled for release in mid-November. Enya issued a press release on her official web site on 19 September stating that this was a mistake and no new album was immediately forthcoming.</p>

<h3><a name="1998"></a>1998&ndash;2007: A Day Without Rain and Amarantine</h3>
<p>In November of 2005, a new album, entitled <a href="{{ url_for('album_amarantine') }}"><em>Amarantine</em></a>, was released. It won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album for 2007. In the following year, Enya released several Christmas-themed CDs with newly recorded material. On October 10, 2006, <em>Sounds of the Season</em> was released containing six songs: the previously released "O&iacute;che Chi&uacute;in" ("Silent Night") and "Amid the Falling Snow", new recordings of the standards "Adeste Fideles" ("Oh Come All Ye Faithful") and "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" as well as two original songs, "Christmas Secrets" and "The Magic of the Night". <em>Sounds of the Season</em> was released only in the United States in an partnership with the NBC television network and the Target department store chain.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Amarantine is an ancient word, which means eternity. The poets describe an undying flower with that word, and I fell in love with that idea ... For me that word suited rhythmically to the refrain of the piece. A-ma-ran-ti-ne. In our website the fans tried to guess something super-romantic to be the album's name, but this word was obviously never guessed by anyone.</p>
	<em>Enya</em>
</blockquote>
<p>In later November two new editions of <em>Amarantine</em> were released. In North America, it was reissued as <a href="{{ url_for('other_songs') }}"><em>Amarantine - Special Christmas Edition</em></a> with a second disc containing the four new Christmas songs previously issued on <em>Sounds of the Season</em>. The UK received a deluxe version of this release (<a href="{{ url_for('other_songs') }}"><em>Amarantine - The UK Special Edition</em></a>) which also included three postcards and a copy of Roma Ryan's book <em>Water Shows the Hidden Heart</em> which is referenced on the original album. Canadian fans could choose from the <a href="{{ url_for('other_songs') }}"><em>Special Christmas Edition of Amarantine</em></a>, or an EP entitled <a href="{{ url_for('other_songs') }}"><em>Christmas Secrets</em></a> which only contained the four new songs.</p> {# TODO: Check enya-other.html for these specific editions / anchors #}

<p>On November 16, 2006, Enya mentioned on ITV1's that she was working on a new album. A month later, in a Japanese interview Enya said that the album would be a complete Christmas album and would be released in 2007, which led to widespread fan speculation. No release occurred at that time.</p>
<p>By mid-2007, Enya have sold 70 million albums. An American businessperson has coined the phrase "enyanomics" to explain Enya's ability to sell millions of records without giving any live performances.</p>
<p>On June 29, 2007, Enya received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland, Galway. The ceremony for six total recipients was held at noon. Shortly after, on July 10, 2007, Enya received a second honorary doctorate from the University of Ulster.</p>
<p>Also in 2007, <a href="https://amzn.to/38qoPzQ"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Enya MP3</a> was made availabe in Amazon.com.</p>

<p>Enya continued to write music with a winter and Christmas theme for her seventh studio album, <em>And Winter Came...</em>. Initially she intended to make an album of seasonal songs and hymns set for a release in late 2007, but decided to produce a winter-themed album instead. The track "My! My! Time Flies!", a tribute to the late Irish guitarist Jimmy Faulkner, incorporates a guitar solo performed by Pat Farrell, the first use of a guitar on an Enya album since "I Want Tomorrow" from Enya. Upon its release in November 2008, <em>And Winter Came...</em> reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 8 in the US[45] and sold almost 3.5 million copies worldwide by 2011.[74]</p>
<p>After promoting <em>And Winter Came...</em>, Enya took an extended break from writing and recording music. She spent her time resting, visiting family in Australia, and renovating her new home in the south of France. In March 2009, her first four studio albums were reissued in Japan in the Super High Material CD format with bonus tracks. Her second compilation album and DVD, <em>The Very Best of Enya</em>, was released in November 2009 and features songs from 1987 to 2008, including a previously unreleased version of "Aniron". In 2013, "Only Time" was used in the "Epic Split" advertisement by Volvo Trucks starring Jean-Claude Van Damme who does the splits while suspended between two lorries. The video went viral, leading to numerous parodies of the commercial uploaded to YouTube also using "Only Time".

	<p>I felt I didn't know what to do ... I thought I needed a break, and the music needed a break ... I know it sounds like a long time, but to me, it felt like six months.</p>

<p>In 2012, Enya returned to the studio to record her eighth album, <em>Dark Sky Island</em>. Its name refers to the island of Sark, where it became the first island to be designated a dark-sky preserve, and a series of poems on islands by Roma Ryan. The new album was promoted with the premiere in October 2015 of its lead single, "Echoes in Rain", on Ken Bruce's radio show and with the release in the same month of the single as a digital download.[79] Upon its release on 20 November 2015, <em>Dark Sky Island</em> went to No. 4 in the UK, Enya's highest charting studio album there since <em>Shepherd Moons</em> went to No. 1, and to No. 8 in the US. A Deluxe Edition features three additional songs. Enya completed a promotional tour of the UK and Europe, the US and Japan. During her visit to Japan, Enya performed "Orinoco Flow" and "Echoes in Rain" at the Universal Studios Japan Christmas show in Osaka. In December 2016, Enya appeared on the RTE Christmas special Christmas Carols from Cork, marking her first Irish television appearance in over seven years. She sang "Adeste Fideles" and "Oiche Chiuin"[90] as well as her own carol composition "The Spirit of Christmas Past".</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Anytime I hear a song, it's the whole story of the song. You actually go into the moment, into that year. It's like a diary: going back to that day, where you had written it, worked on it, the life of it, the day you finished it. What you ate that day, the earrings you wore. Every song &mdash; every song is a punch in the gut.</p>

<p>Enya sings in Gaelic (her native tongue), English, Latin, Spanish, Japanese, Welsh, French, as well as Quenya and Sindarin, two languages invented by J.R.R. Tolkien. In her most recent album <a href="{{ url_for('album_amarantine') }}"><em>Amarantine</em></a>, Enya uses a fictional language called Loxian.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Irish Gaelic</strong>: "March of the Celts", "The Celts", "Aldebaran", "Deireadh An Tuath", "Triad (St. Patrick)", "Storms In Africa", "The Longships", "Na Laetha Geal M'oige", "Oiche Chiun", "Ebudae", "Book of Days", "Smaointe", "Athair Ar Neamh", "'S Fagaim Mo Bhaile", "As Baile", "Deora Ar Mo Chroi"</li>
    <li><strong>French</strong>: part of "Only If"</li>
    <li><strong>Japanese</strong>: "Sumiregusa"</li>
    <li><strong>Latin</strong>: "Cursum Perficio", "Afer Ventus", "Pax Deorum", "Tempus Vernum", "Adeste, Fideles"</li>
    <li><strong>Spanish</strong>: "La Sonadora"</li>
    <li><strong>Welsh</strong>: "Dan y Dwr"</li>

    <li><strong>Quenya</strong>: part of "May It Be"</li>
    <li><strong>Loxian</strong>: "Less Than A Pearl", "The River Sings", "Water Shows The Hidden Heart"</li>
</ul>

<h4>What is Loxian?</h4>
<p>Loxian is a fictional language created by Roma Ryan. The language was created especially for Enya's music because Gaelic, Latin or English didn't seem to fit the particular mood of certain songs. The idea to create a fictional language was inspired by the previous use of Tolkien's fictional languages Quenya and Sindarin, used in the songs for the Lord of The Rings soundtrack. Roma Ryan has written a book called <em>Water Shows the Hidden Heart</em> about the how and why of Loxian.</p>

<h4>Was that Enya I heard? Is this song really an Enya song?</h4>
<p>Enya Lyrics lists every song that Enya has written, sung, or performed; look under the <a href="{{ url_for('all_songs') }}">complete list of Enya songs</a>. Be aware that several illegal sites and P2Ps networks offer songs which often wrongly attribute songs to Enya. For example, "Now We Are Free", "Gladiator Theme", "Harry's Game", and "Love Song" are often wrongly listed as Enya's music.</p>

<h4>How many records has she sold?</h4>
<p>Enya has sold more than 70 million albums worldwide. Her best selling album to date is <a href="{{ url_for('album_a_day_without_rain') }}"><em>A Day Without Rain</em></a> which has sold more than 12 million copies.
