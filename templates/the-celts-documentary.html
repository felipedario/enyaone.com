<p style="font-size:.9em; margin-bottom:0;"><em>Enya performs <a href="{{ url_for('video_i_want_tomorrow') }}">"I Want Tomorrow"</a> during a musical interlude in</em> The Celts<em>.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The series is best known for introducing mainstream audiences to Enya. Enya, formerly a member of the Celtic band, <a href="{{ url_for('enya_clannad') }}">Clannad</a>, was commissioned to compose the score for this series. In addition, Enya is shown performing the theme song, "The Celts" at the start of each episode, and two episodes also include music videos of her performing the songs <a href="{{ url_for('video_i_want_tomorrow') }}">"I Want Tomorrow</a>" and <a href="{{ url_for('video_aldebaran') }}">"Aldebaran"</a>. The

<p>The performance of <a href="{{ url_for('video_i_want_tomorrow') }}">"I Want Tomorrow"</a> is notable for the out-of-character way in which Enya is presented: she appears clad in leather biker gear in one sequence and shooting fire from her fingertips in another. </p>

<p>The song <a href="{{ url_for('album_the_celts') }}#The_Celts">"The Celts"</a> was the main title theme for the series.</p>

<h3>Albums</h3>

<p>The <a href="{{ url_for('album_enya') }}"><em>Enya</em></a> album was recorded in 1986, and released in 1987, when the series was
first broadcast. The album was first released in the UK by the BBC on
their own label, and later issued in North America by Atlantic Records. It features music
written and recorded for the soundtrack of <em>The Celts</em>.</p>

<p><a href="{{ url_for('album_the_celts') }}"><em>The Celts</em></a>, released in 1992, is a remastered re-release of <em>Enya</em>. Aside from the enhanced sound, <em>The Celts</em> also contains a longer
version of the instrumental song "Portrait" (which runs for 1:23, found on the
original release <em>Enya</em>), entitled "Portrait: Out Of The Blue" (3:11).</p>

<h3>Unreleased music</h3>

<p>The <a href="{{ url_for('album_enya') }}"><em>Enya</em></a> album contains only 36 minutes worth of the music composed by Enya for the series, with an unknown amount of material as yet unreleased. To date the only "lost track" to see the light of day is the instrumental "Spaghetti Western Theme from The Celts" which appears on some editions of the 2005 CD single for <a href="{{ url_for('album_amarantine') }}#Amarantine">"Amarantine"</a>.</p>

<div class="c"></div>

<p>According to <a href="{{ url_for('roma_ryan_nicky') }}">Roma Ryan</a>, Enya's lyricist, "[t]he director had various pastiches in the programme and wanted music to compliment these. Thus the music ranges from a "Spaghetti Western" through to "The Third Man" and "The Haunted House" to the more familiar tracks embodied on the soundtrack album. What happened to the other tracks? I hear you say. We still have them!"</p>
