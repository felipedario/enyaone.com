instrumental and repetitively melodic in nature.</p>

<h3>New age</h3>

Instrumentation: It can be quite diverse! You'll find acoustic instruments like piano, harp, and flute, alongside electronic instruments and nature sounds (think flowing water or birdsong).  </li>
<li>Melody and Harmony: Generally features gentle melodies and harmonies, avoiding complex structures or jarring sounds.
Tempo: Usually slow and flowing, helping to create that relaxed vibe.
