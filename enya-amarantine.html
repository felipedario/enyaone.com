<p>Enya's mesmerizing seventh album, <strong><em>Amarantine</em></strong>, made its debut on November 22, 2005. Recognizing its outstanding artistry, the album was honored with the prestigious Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in 2007, solidifying Enya's musical prowess. Within the enchanting tapestry of <em>Amarantine</em> a unique linguistic journey unfolds. While Irish Gaelic takes a backseat in this particular album, Enya and Roma Ryan ventured into uncharted territory, weaving three songs with an invented language known as Loxian. Described by Enya and Roma Ryan to <em>The Times</em> as "a futuristic language from a distant planet," Loxian adds an ethereal touch to the album's lyrical landscape. This creative endeavor was born out of their previous experiences crafting songs in Tolkien's Elvish languages, such as "May it Be" and "An&iacute;ron."</p>

<p>Following the release of her compilation box set Only Time â€“ The Collection (2002), Enya took a short break before she started work on a new album in September 2003, her first since <em><a href="a-day-without-rain.html">A Day Without Rain</a></em> (2000). <em>Amarantine</em> was recorded in Ireland with her longtime recording partners, <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan</a>.</p>

<p>The release date was announced by Roma Ryan on September 23,
2005 at
the official Enya forum. It was subsequently leaked to the Internet on
November 11, 2005.</p>

<p>The promotional photography was shot by Simon Fowler
during two days in June 2005 at <a href="http://www.knebworthhouse.com/">Knebworth House</a>, Hertfordshire, England.</p>

<p>A <a href="video-amarantine.html">music video for the first single "Amarantine"</a> was directed by Tim Royes. The surreal forest through which Enya walks was created by digital matte painter Charles Darby
(<em>The Fifth Element</em>, <em>Titanic</em>, <em>The Matrix</em>).</p>

<p>The album was launched on November 27 in the Castle of Vaux Le Vicomte, France. Record company Warner gave Enya, who wore a stunning red gown by Maria Grachvogel, an impressive banquet starting with fireworks set to the new music.</p>

<div style="margin: 0 0 1em 30px; float: right; width: 348px;">
<img src="iitr.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 0;text-align:right;">
<em>Enya in <a href="video-its-in-the-rain.html">"It's In The Rain" music video</a>.</em></p>
</div>

<p>In November 2006, an extended version of the album was issued (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJSJYQ?tag=enylyrallenys-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B000JJSJYQ&adid=04VTYCY773AGB65NC7WP&">Amarantine - Special Christmas Edition</a></em>), containing four additional
Christmas-themed tracks.</p>

<p>Three songs on <em>Amarantine</em> are sung in a fictional language Loxian created by Enya's lyricist Roma Ryan.
The idea arose after Roma'd written lyrics in Elvish for <em><a href="the-lord-of-the-rings.html">The Lord Of The Rings - The Fellowship
of the Ring</a></em>. The
main influence is from the sounds that Enya sings while the songs don't have actual lyrics yet.</p>

Loxian songs:
<ul>
<li><a href="#Less_than_a_pearl">Less Than A Pearl - Heah Viiya</a></li>
<li><a href="#The_River_Sings">The River Sings - Ea Hymm Llay Hey</a></li>
<li><a href="#Water_shows_the_hidden_heart">Water Shows The Hidden Heart - Syoombrraya</a></li>
</ul>

<p>About that language, Enya says that "[t]he Loxians, are much like us. They're in space, somewhere in the night. They're looking out, they're mapping the stars, and wondering if there is anyone else out there. It's to do with that concept: are we alone in the universe?"</p>

<p>On December 5, 2005, Roma published <em>Water Shows the Hidden Heart</em>,
book icluding her poetry and story behind the Loxian songs. The re-release is 
available as a part of Deluxe Collector's edition of <em>Amarantine</em> (November 2006).<p>

<p>In September 2004 a new Enya song named "Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)" was released in Japan as part of an advertising campaign for Panasonic. As part of the announcement of the new song, Warner Music Japan stated that Enya's next album would be released in November 2004. On September 19, 2004 Enya made a press release available via her website stating that no release was immediately planned.</p>

<p>"Sumiregusa" has been included as one of the tracks on the Amarantine album. The "Sumiregusa" song was also used by Panasonic to advertise its products in Japan, featuring in TV commercials advertising its "Viera" and "Diga" range of flat-screen TVs and DVD recorders. The commercials appeared on several national TV channels for several weeks, helping both Panasonic and Enya's sales.</p>

<p>Enya has said that <a href="#Amarantine">"Amarantine"</a> and <a href="#If_I_could_be_where_you_are">"If I
Could Be Where You Are"</a> are her favourite songs of the album.

<p>Release date: November 22, 2005<br />
Released as CD and cassette</p>

</strong>
Out of night has come the day<br />

Out of night, our small earth.<br />

<br />

Our words drift away.<br />

Our words journey<br />

to find those who will listen.<br />

<br />

We call out into the distance...<br />

We call out into the distance...<br />

We call out into the distance...<br />

We call out into the distance...<br />

<br />

Less than a pearl in a sea of stars,<br />

we are a lost island in the shadows.<br />

<br />

It may be our words become lost.<br />

It may be our words find nothing, find no-one.<br />

<br />

We call out into the distance...<br />

We call out into the distance...<br />

Every time<br />


the rain comes down,<br />


close my eyes and listen.<br />


I can hear the lonesome sound<br />


of the sky as it cries.<br />


<br />


Listen to the rain<br />


Here it comes again<br />


Hear it in the rain<br />


<br />


Feel the touch<br />


of tears that fall<br />


-they won't fall forever<br />


In the way the day will flow<br />


all things come,<br />


all things go.<br />

<br />


Listen to the rain<br />


...the rain...<br />


Here it comes again...<br />


...again...<br />


Hear it in the rain<br />


...the rain...<br />


<br />


Late at night<br />


I drift away -<br />


I can hear you calling,<br />


and my name<br />


is in the rain,<br />


leaves on trees whispering,<br />


deep blue sea's mysteries.<br />


<br />


Even when<br />


this moment ends,<br />


can't let go this feeling.<br />


Everything<br />


will come again<br />


in the sound,<br />


falling down,<br />


of the sky as it cries.<br />


Hear my name in the rain.<br />

<em>Roma Ryan</em><br />


<br />


Summer. When the day is over<br />

there's a heart a little colder;<br />


someone said goodbye,<br />


but you don't know why.<br />


Somewhere there is someone keeping<br />


all the tears they have been weeping,<br />


someone said goodbye,<br />


but you don't know why.<br />


<br />


Is there a reason<br />


why a broken heart begins to cry?<br />


Is there a reason<br />


you were lost although you don't know why?<br />


Give me a reason<br />

why you never want to say goodbye.<br />


If there's a reason,<br />


I don't know why.<br />


<br />


Always looking for a meaning,<br />


all the time you keep believing,<br />


but I don't know why<br />


you won't say goodbye.<br />


Even when the sun is shining<br />

you don't see the silver lining,<br />


but I don't know why<br />


you won't say goodbye.<br />


<br />


Is there a reason<br />


why a broken dream can never fly?<br />


Is there a reason<br />


you believe and then you close your eyes?<br />


Give me a reason<br />

why you hide away so much inside.<br />


If there's a reason,<br />


I don't know why.<br />


<br />


Is there a reason<br />


why a broken heart begins to cry?<br />


Is there a reason<br />


you were lost although you don't know why?<br />


Give me a reason<br />

why you never want to say goodbye.<br />


If there's a reason<br />

</strong>
Our words go beyond the moon.<br />

Our words go into the shadows.<br />

The river sings the endlessness.<br />

We write of our journey through night.<br />

We write in our aloneness.<br />

We want to know the shape of eternity.<br />

<br />

Who knows the way it is?<br />

Who knows what time will not tell us?<br />

<br />

Mountains, solitude and the moon<br />

until the journey's end?<br />

The river holds the lost road of the sky;<br />

the shape of eternity?<br />

<br />

Who knows the way it is?<br />

Who knows what time will not tell us?<br />

<br />

Where is the beginning?<br />

Where is the end?<br />

Why did we fall into days?<br />

Why are we calling out into the endlessness?<br />

<br />

Who knows the way it is?<br />

Who knows what time will not tell us?<br />

<em>Roma Ryan</em><br />


<br />


How I remember sleepless nights<br />

when we would read by candlelight,<br />


and on the windowpane outside<br />


a new world made of snow;<br />


<br />


a million feathers falling down,<br />


a million stars that touch the ground,<br />


so many secrets to be found<br />


amid the falling snow.<br />


<br />


Maybe I am falling down.<br />


Tell me should I touch the ground?<br />


Maybe I won't make a sound<br />


in the darkness all around.<br />


<br />


The silence of a winter's night<br />


brings memories I hold inside;<br />


remembering a blue moonlight<br />


upon the fallen snow.<br />

<br />


Maybe I am falling down.<br />


Tell me should I touch the ground?<br />


Maybe I won't make a sound<br />


in the darkness all around.<br />


<br />


I close my window to the night.<br />


I leave the sky her tears of white.<br />


And all is lit by candlelight<br />


amid the falling snow.<br />


<br />


And all is lit by candlelight<br />


amid the falling snow.<br />

From the City of Constellations<br />

to the wanderer<br />

and a Place of Rains<br />

he journeys on...<br />

...the City of hesitation and doubt<br />

the Island of the house the colour of the sea<br />

the Plain of Mementoes<br />

he journeys on to find his love...<br />

...the Valley of lost time<br />

the City of End and Endlessness<br />

the Isle of Revenents<br />

he journeys on...<br />

...the City of Solitudes<br />

the City of the distance from you<br />

the City of Words of blue<br />

and yellow and red and green<br />

he journeys on to find his love...<br />

<br />

...where the road takes him throuh<br />

the City of Sleep<br />

the thinking that does not end is within him<br />

Then he dreams<br />

the road takes him<br />

this man who is searching<br />

it brings him<br />

in silence through the night<br />

<br />

where the Cities that do not Exist, exist<br />

it brings him<br />

in silence through the night<br />

close to the City of Realisations;<br />

it is here one finds the way...<br />

...Mount Orison<br />

the City of Days<br />

the Tree of the lost<br />

he journeys on...<br />

...north of his love<br />

a road through a valley of darkness<br />

the islands that are not of this world<br />

he journeys on to find his love...<br />

<br />

It is a long way through darkness<br />

to the way of the eremite<br />

the eremite sings of the world and of<br />

the journey of love, which is not lost in eternity<br />

...the Valley where the moon is caught in the trees<br />

water shows the hidden heart<br />

endlong into midnight<br />

he journeys on...<br />

...the parable of day<br />

the Room of Books<br />

where the winds come to him and say...<br />
<br />

<h3><a name="linearnotes"></a>Linear notes</h3>

<h4>Less than a Pearl</h4>
<p>"...yet there is one sound that is not their own and 
which their hearts yearn to have. It is the sound of the Song 
of the Loxians. It is a sound that awakens in Valley-dwellers a 
strange feeling, one they cannot know yet one that is more 
familiar to them than their own heartbeat. And it awakens in 
the hearts of all the Valley-dwellers a longing that brings them 
to the edge of tears, because it is the song of both the 
beginning and the end..."</p>

<h4>Amarantine</h4>
<p>The word Amarantine I have used in the song Flora's 
secret. In that song the word was spelt a little differently. 
Then, it signified the colour purple and the eyes of a flower 
looking up to heavens.</p>
<p>In this song, Amarantine means "everlasting".</p>
<p>It is a song about love.</p>

<h4>It's in the rain</h4>
<p>A small oasis. A harbour. A haven.<p>
<p>The sound of the rain can soothe the mond. Quiet moments 
of reflection and imagination.</p>

<h4>If I could be where you are</h4>
<p>This is a song of sadness, for how else can one describe 
such sorrow? Not knowing where a loved one is, not knowing 
how they are, not knowing how to find them.</p>
<p>They are the missing.</p>

<h4>The River Sings</h4>
<p>This song is one of the trilogy of songs which come from 
the book "Water shows the hidden heart" and is 
written in the Loxian language. It is a song in which people send 
their words out into the night. It is a song expressing their 
quest to discover if they are alone in the universe and wonder 
if they will ever find other life within the vastness of 
space.</p>

<h4>Long Long Journey</h4>
<p>Faraway places. Oceans. Other lands.</p>
<p>Yet all 
the heart wants is to be home. This is a song about that 
journey home, no matter how far that journey is. For what 
are miles across the ocean to the heart that's coming 
home?</p>

<h4>Sumiregusa</h4>
<p>The lyrics are inspired by a hokku by the Japanese poet 
Basho, which was written while he was travelling to Otsu, in 
which he says that on his way through the mountain road his 
heart leapt at the sight of a wild violet.</p>
<p>I am sure we have all experienced an intense 
moment when we are moved by some part of nature.</p>
<p>Perhaps an epiphany.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a celebration of life.</p>
<p>Perhaps just a moment that is ours alone.</p>

<h4>Someone said goodbye</h4>

<p>Everywhere life happens to everyone.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the day is over, reflection 
might bring saddest times to mind. This song is about those 
feelings.</p>

<h4>A Moment Lost</h4>
<p>Words written in the sand disappear with the day, as the 
waves wash in and erase them. But words given to us in 
anger or in spite, particularly by one whom we loveve, etch 
themselves into the hidden corners of the heart and burn. 
They do not disappear with he day, but find themselves 
echoed in the night until other words come, to heal, to 
comfort, to restore love.</p>
<p>This is a song of regret about words uttered, and 
a song of love about words which are forgiven.</p>

<h4>Amid the falling snow</h4>
<p>And the air was filled with feathers...</p>
<p>It recalls the moment when you are first 
mesmerized by the falling snow as a child, remembering the 
wonder experienced as a child, particularly the magic of 
Christmastide. And there are those who even as they grow 
older are still able to experience the wonder of snow.</p>


<h4>Water shows the hidden heart</h4>

<p>This is a song telling the story of a man who is looking for 
whom he loves and hast lost. It desribes his emotional 
journey in images - cities, islands, valleys. memories and 
emotions take a physical form, a visualization. The lyric itself is 
adapted from a book of the same name which describes these 
places, this journey.</p>
<p>"...he looks into the eyes of the water and 
sees his own eyes, looking. They reflect everything, these 
waters, even the hidden heart."</p>
