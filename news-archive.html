<p><strong class="date">October 16 2008 &mdash;</strong> The British newspaper <em>The Telegraph</em> has just posted a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/12/sv_enya.xml&page=1">new interview</a> with our beloved singer.

<h4>Enya plans live concert; new tribute song</h4>
<img src="elive.jpg" alt="Enya Live" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" />
<p><strong class="date">October 13 2008 &mdash;</strong> Enya
is
considering her first live concerts, as she told in the <a href="http://www.hotpress.com/news/4874398.html">press
conference</a> for
her new album <a href="and-winter-came.html"><em>And Winter Came&hellip;</em></a>: &ldquo;We're always
talking about how exciting it
would be to do a live performance of this music. But it has to be the
right
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her
producer Nicky Ryan confirmed the preparations: &ldquo;There are
serious talks going
on at the moment. I think it would be a good idea. At this stage we
either do
it or we don't. We were talking to America on Wednesday about the
possibility
of doing a performance. Our preference would be to do it in Europe. It
wouldn't
be a tour, just a performance, and we would film it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The
last
recorded song for the new album, &ldquo;My! My! Time
Flies!&rdquo;, is a tribute to the
late Irish guitarist Jimmy Faulkner. &ldquo;The song involves a
slight departure for
Enya featuring guitar solos as well as references to The Beatles, Elvis
and B.B
King&rdquo;, according to <a href="http://www.hotpress.com/news/4874398.html">Hot Press</a>. &ldquo;Dubliner Pat
Farrell is the featured guitarist
on the track, which insiders are forecasting will be the third single,
with a
likely release date in the new year.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>September 2008</h3>

<h4>Single premieres in UK radio!</h4>

<p><strong class="date">September 29 2008 &mdash;</strong> Terry Wogan played "Trains and Winter Rains" on his morning programme Wake up to Wogan today in BBC Radio Two.</p>

<p>"Trains and Winter Rains" is the first single of the new Enya album <em><a href="and-winter-came.html">And Winter Came</a></em>.</p>

<h4>First song names, more release dates and bigger cover</h4>

<p><strong class="date">September 18 2008 &mdash;</strong> Warner
Music Norway confirmed in their site (link missing now, but
we&rsquo;ll try to
retrieve it soon) five track names of the new Enya album, <a href="and-winter-came.html"><em>And
Winter Came...</em></a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>Trains
and Winter Rains</strong>&rdquo;: the rumored first single to be
released in September
29th, a new song in English.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>White is the Winter Night</strong>&rdquo; a new song in English, described
by Nicky Ryan as &ldquo;the
kind of song you could hear at the Proms with everyone joining in, it
has that
kind of Christmassy vibe.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>Journey
of the Angels</strong>&rdquo;: a new song in English.</p>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>Oh
Come, Oh Come, Emmanuel</strong>&rdquo;: a version of the Latin
carol &ldquo;Veni Veni&rdquo;, rumored
to be sung in Latin. </li>

<li>&ldquo;<strong>O&iacute;che
Ch&iacute;un (Silent Night)</strong>&rdquo;: a re-recorded version of the Enya Christmas classic, in Gaelic.
Enya says that &ldquo;It was exciting to re-live &lsquo;Silent
Night&rsquo; because I sung that
twenty years ago. It is re-released every year in America and it was so
nice to go back and do something different with it.&rdquo; The new
rendering incorporates
what Nicky describes as the &ldquo;choir of one&rdquo;,
multi-layering Enya vocals. &ldquo;I
enjoy the process, I love the excitement of not knowing if it will
work,&rdquo; admits Enya.</li>
<li>And we can count that, like in all past Enya albums, &ldquo;<strong>And Winter Came...</strong>&rdquo; may be a song title
as well. Warner also said that the album comprises 12 songs, 10 in English and none instrumental (the first Enya album without them!).</li></ul>
<p>Roma also talks about the title and the &ldquo;sense of possibility that Christmas
brings&rdquo;: &ldquo;some
people see it <em>[the winter]</em> as an ending, with a
whole story before it, but
I see it very much as a new beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More
specific release dates were also disclosed:</p>
<ul><li>US:
November
11th (by Amazon.com)</li>
<li>Japan:
November
12th (by Warner Music Japan)</li></ul>
<p>Finally,

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2008-Release-Enya%2Fdp%2FB001EI5CA0&tag=enylyrallenys-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">a

<h4>OFFICIAL: Winter coming earlier for Enya fans!</h4>

<p><strong class="date">September 15 2008 &mdash;</strong> Enya
just announced in her revamped official website that her new album, <em><a href="and-winter-came.html">And Winter Came...</a></em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2008-Release-Enya%2Fdp%2FB001EI5CA0&tag=enylyrallenys-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">pre-order on Amazon.com</a>), will be released on November 10<sup>th</sup>. Enya says
that she &ldquo;always wanted to do a Christmas album, but as we began recording I didn't feel it was right to impose a Christmas theme on certain  songs.&rdquo;</p>

<a href="and-winter-came.html"><img src="newalbum.jpg" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 10px 0;" alt="Enya new album cover" /></a>
<p>The album cover was also revealed, though in a small size.</p>
<p><a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Nicky Ryan</a>, her producer since <a href="enya-album.html">the first album</a>, adds that they &ldquo;started out writing for a
Christmas album, but it has evolved into more an Enya album based in a
winter landscape where Christmas arrives here and there, but it would be wrong to call it an Enya Christmas album.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;The Loxian Games&rdquo; started; new album in November?</h4>

<p><strong class="date">September 4 2008 &mdash;</strong> Amazon.com
is currently <a

We still don&rsquo;t have an official confirmation from Enya.com, but Amazon is generally trustworthy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t found your way through the exciting new Enya official competition &ldquo;The Loxian
Games&rdquo;, visit Enya.com, enter the Castle, go to the &ldquo;Roma&rsquo;s Library&rdquo; and then
click in the &ldquo;Book of Riddles&rdquo; to start the quest! The competition guidebook,
the Loxian Oracle and the books and hidden stuff in Enya&rsquo;s,
Roma&rsquo;s and Nicky&rsquo;s
site should help you.</p>
<p>Below we&rsquo;ll provide a little and incomplete guide of the games; it is a spoiler, so highlight it if you really want to read it.</p>
<ul style="color:#fff">
<li>You should look through Enya&rsquo;s, Roma&rsquo;s and
Nicky&rsquo;s sites and in the Loxian Oracle
for clues that will give you 4 lost lines of a new song, that you
should input
in the Book of Lost Lyric at Roma&rsquo;s site.</li>

<li>You may enter the first question in the Loxian Oracle, which should give you a clue. If it didn&rsquo;t work, turn up the volume of your PC speakers or headphones, and ask the same question multiple times.</li>
<li>The oracles voice seems to be of a woman, just slowed down. And yes, she&rsquo;s talking in English.</li>
<li>Type your answer to the riddle, in the Secret Room in Enya&rsquo;s site, and then hit enter. It will say &ldquo;checking&rdquo;. If you are correct you will receive the next piece of the riddle. Reloading the page may help  too.</li>
<li>Go back to the Oracle and try asking again. Note that the Oracle
won&rsquo;t give the answer, but it will guide you. And it doesn&rsquo;t have the answer for everything.</li>
<li>The oracle should also give URLs for other sites, where
you&rsquo;ll find other clues,
and times an place. She may say things figuratively.</li>

<li>If you find the game too difficult, or want to talk with more players, try the Enya Forum. You should register and then wait a few days to be accepted. </li>
</ul>
<p>Above all, have fun!</p>

<p>Nicky Ryan, Enya&rsquo;s producer since the 1980s, released <a href="http://www.nickyryan.net/">his personal web site</a> this week, featuring a new instrumental song called &ldquo;Echoes of

<h4>Top 10 Enya songs (Part 7) &mdash; Article</h4>

<p><strong class="date">July 11 2008 &mdash;</strong> After one month on
vacations, we&rsquo;re ready to continue our list of best Enya
Songs, this time with a Latin piece.</p>

<img src="afad.jpg" alt="Enya Lyrics" />

<h5><strong>#4 &ldquo;Afer Ventus&rdquo;</strong>, from 1991&rsquo;s album <a href="shepherd-moons.html">Shepherd Moons</a></h5>

<p>According to Enya&rsquo;s right arm, Roma Ryan, who writes nearly all her songs, &ldquo;Afer Ventus&rdquo; talks about the <em>Epiphany</em>, that magical moment of &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; and comprehension of the world gears. &ldquo;The moment experienced when everything in life suddenly makes sense&mdash;when everything fits into place and we know why&mdash;is a rare moment, but it does
 appen&rdquo;, she adds in <a href="shepherd-moons.html#linearnotes"><em>Shepherd Moons</em> linear notes</a>. &ldquo;If we are lucky enough we can bathe in the brevity of that moment for it passes as quickly as it arrives. Like [James] Joyce&rsquo;s <em>Epiphanies</em> they can sometimes seem trivial, but are always crucial and revealing moments in our lives, delicate and fleeting. In &lsquo;Afer Ventus&rsquo; it is those moments of pure enlightenment which are  described&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afer Ventus&rdquo; is surely a calm, reflexive song. Enya calls winds, seas, stars and planets to tell a history of self-knowledge and to advise the listener that the life is short,
unique and is &ldquo;earth-born&rdquo; even if &ldquo;we go to the
stars&rdquo;, that is, life should be lived intensely,
but with care at the same time. Latin, as a ancient language, adds
weight and profoundness to the song, like it was indeed an ancient history.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to agree
with my humble interpretation: just <a href="mailto:orangax@gmail.com">send me an email</a> saying what you
think about &ldquo;Afer Ventus&rdquo; and/or your own top ten Enya
songs. I&rsquo;ll be very glad to hear you and to publish your opinions here.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! And please, keep
enjoying Enya Lyrics.</p>

<h4>Top 10 Enya songs (Part 6) &mdash; Article</h4>
<p><strong class="date">May 29 2008 &mdash;</strong> After
some delay, &ldquo;we keep on going&rdquo; in our list of the <strong>best Enya songs</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>#5 &ldquo;Storms In Africa&rdquo;</strong>, from 1988&rsquo;s album <em><a href="watermark.html">Watermark</a></em></h5>
<div style="float:right; width:200px;margin:5px 0 1em 20px;"><img src="sia-ad1.JPG" alt="Storms In Africa" /></div>
<p>This song has two versions. Version I is a Gaelic piece that talks about a &ldquo;Great journey &hellip; through the storms&rdquo;, without mentioning Africa directly. The second version is in English, is faster and has rain and thunder sounds. (This version has a <a href="video-storms-in-africa-english.html">video</a>, a little cheesy like any other 80&rsquo;s video, but very good otherwise, with Enya, two girls, African percussionists
and all that safari animals.)</p>
<p>The Gaelic version is my personal favorite&mdash;and Enya&rsquo;s too, as Roma Ryan, her lyricist, remarks
in the Only Time Collection.</p>
<p>Enya talks a lot about journeys in her songs, but isn&rsquo;t the life itself a great journey? A journey where everything can change suddenly: &ldquo;Though I walk through warm sands in Africa, winds will grow soon to storm&rdquo;, as she say in version II.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know when life ends&mdash;or when it begins, as many pregnancies are unexpected: &ldquo;How long is it from beginning to end&rdquo; (version I) and &ldquo;How far to go? I cannot say&rdquo; (version II).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storms&hellip;&rdquo; also talks about the renovation of
life: &ldquo;Dark skies fall down into another day&rdquo; and
the need of being bold in what you make: &ldquo;Lift your heart! Walk through the storms &hellip; Go through the storms&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Both versions have a deep, strong percussion and a tribal-like &ldquo;Na na na&rdquo; women chorus, inspired by the ancient African music.</p>

<h4>Top 10 Enya songs (Part 5) &mdash; Article</h4>
<p><strong class="date">May 12 2008 &mdash;</strong> Our list of the <strong>best Enya songs</strong> continues this week, with a rather ironic theme for this season if you&rsquo;re in the US or Europe: winter.</p>
<h5><strong>#6 &ldquo;<a href="enya-amarantine.html#Amid_the_falling_snow">Amid
the Falling Snow</a>&rdquo;</strong>, from 2005&rsquo;s <em><a href="enya-amarantine.html">Amarantine</a></em> album.</h5>

<div style="margin: 0pt 30px 1em 0pt; float: left; width: 200px;">

</div>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in Brazil like me, you can believe it&rsquo;s snowing out there while listening to &ldquo;Amid the Falling Snow&rdquo;, because we&rsquo;re in a rainy fall right now in this country. The Christmas mood of this song is remarkable, and because of this, it made into the <a href="enya-other.html"><em>Sounds of the Season/Christmas
Secrets</em> albums</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It recalls the moment when you are first mesmerized by the falling snow as a child, remembering the wonder experienced as a child &hellip; And there are those who even as they grow older are still able to experience the wonder of snow&rdquo;, says Roma Ryan, Enya&rsquo;s lyricist, about &ldquo;Amid the Falling Snow&rdquo;. I surely haven&rsquo;t saw snow myself, but this piece is like a big picture of a small town on a white Christmas like those in the Christmas TV specials. Wouldn&rsquo;t you give some puddings to the
Enya-chorus?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amid &hellip;&rdquo; is also a very &ldquo;remember good times&rdquo;, nostalgic song. It has a very direct lyric: Enya remembering her childhood winters, with her house surrounded by snow while reading by candlelight (even if I don&rsquo;t think they still needed candlelights in the 1960s in Ireland). So even if you&rsquo;re in the North hemisphere in a colorful spring, you still may believe that&rsquo;s already winter listening to &ldquo;Amid the Falling Snow&rdquo;. Merry Christmas! :)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Orinoco Flow&rdquo;, also known by its chorus &ldquo;Sail Away&rdquo;, is for many people their first ever Enya song. It was a
very different song when released (and it keeps being so today), and
immediately caught everybody&rsquo;s attention when played. The
violin pizzicato, the somewhat tribal percussion, the harp-like synthesizer and Enya&rsquo;s trademarked one-voice
chorus, performing both women and men parts, is only saw in other Enya
songs, if ever. </p>
<p>This songs lyric has a feeling of discovery, of trying something new. Traveling the many places cited in this song (&ldquo;Ebud&amp;aelig;
into Khartoum&rdquo;, &ldquo;Peru to Cebu&rdquo;), in a
metaphorical way, is learning the world of possibilities that we may have if we allows ourselves to try new things and don&rsquo;t be afraid of failing. Enya herself sounds excited while singing, as she
does look in the <a href="video-orinoco-flow-sail-away.html">&ldquo;Orinoco Flow&rdquo; music video</a>.</p>

<h4>Top 10 Enya songs (Part 3) &mdash; Article</h4>
<p><strong class="date">April 11 2008 &mdash;</strong> The list of <strong>best Enya songs</strong> goes on.</p>
<h5><strong>#8 &ldquo;<a href="enya-amarantine.html#Its_in_the_rain">It's In The Rain</a>&rdquo;</strong>, from the 2005&rsquo;s <a href="enya-amarantine.html"><em>Amarantine</em> album</a>.</h5>
<a class="featimg" href="enya-amarantine.html#Its_in_the_rain"><img src="iitr10.png" alt="It's In The Rain single cover" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s In The Rain&rdquo; is a simple, straightforward song, following the mood of previous track in the album, &ldquo;<a href="enya-amarantine.html#Amarantine">Amarantine</a>&rdquo;. For me, it talks about moments to reflect, to meditate. Just get into the falling rain, and make good use of the sky tears. Maybe in the silence of the rain we can listen to our own heart&mdash;so &ldquo;hear it in the rain&rdquo;! In the second verse, she talks about the time that never stops: &ldquo;all things come, / all things go.&rdquo; So you need to take a time to think about what you&rsquo;re doing in your life&mdash;is this a really good thing?&mdash;before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Sorry if I&rsquo;m being a bit dramatic in the songs analysis. I really never thought about all this things before needing to write about them. Maybe what Enya &ldquo;says&rdquo; get into our subconscious&mdash;and this is good, because she always have positive messages and social critiques in her music, even when so many people says that Enya is &ldquo;easy listening&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<h4>Top 10 Enya songs (Part 2) &mdash; Article</h4>
<p><strong class="date">March 30 2008 &mdash;</strong>  continuing our list of <strong>best Enya songs</strong>, we have now...</p>
<h5><strong>#9 &ldquo;<a href="the-memory-of-trees.html">The Memory of Trees</a>&rdquo;</strong>, from the 1995&rsquo;s <a href="the-memory-of-trees.html">eponymous album</a>.</h5>
<p>According to <a href="roma-ryan-nicky.html">Roma Ryan</a>, who writes all Enya songs, &ldquo;In ancient Celtic belief trees had spirits within them and were considered sacred. They were the keepers of memory and lore.&rdquo; This is an instrumental song, with Enya&rsquo;s classical one-voice chorus singing understandable words that convey tranquility. The perceived passivity of the trees (the piano) is put together with the powerful and mysterious chants of &ldquo;biondella&rdquo;, that may be blow by the wind through the leaves and branches.</p>
<p>I still want to hear you: which is
your Enya top ten songs? And what you think about &ldquo;The Memory of Trees&rdquo;? Email me: <a href="mailto:orangax@gmail.com&subject=Enya%20Lyrics%20-%20Top%20ten%20Enya%20songs">orangax@gmail.com</a>. Your opinion will be published here.</p>

<h4>Top 10 Enya songs (Part 1) &mdash; Article</h4>
<p><strong class="date">March 25 2008 &mdash;</strong> Selecting Enya best songs isn&rsquo;t an easy work. Her albums made into the bestsellers world
wide, with so many beautiful songs. She sometimes calm us down
(&ldquo;<a href="enya-other.html#Adeste_Fideles">Adeste, Fidelis</a>&rdquo;), sometimes make us cry (&ldquo;<a href="a-day-without-rain.html#Only_Time">Only Time</a>&rdquo;), and surely cause many more feelings.</p>
<p>But, as any fan, I have my personal favorites, and
I&rsquo;d like to share them with you. Starting from now,
I&rsquo;ll rank the <strong>10 Best Enya songs</strong>, one per week, followed by a small analysis.</p>
<h5><strong>#10 &ldquo;<a href="the-memory-of-trees.html#Anywhere_Is">Anywhere Is</a>&rdquo;</strong>, from 1995&rsquo;s <a href="the-memory-of-trees.html"><em>The Memory Of Trees</em></a>.</h5>
<p>Enya talks about the need to always keep going. Like the moon
and sea waves, that never stops, even without knowing why, we either
should stop. This is the circle of life: there&rsquo;s not really a finish. And our way may lead us to everywhere we want to. After all,
it&rsquo;s made by us, isn&rsquo;t it? And the song per se is beautiful and compelling, with a <em>fake
end</em>&mdash;again, Enya says &ldquo;keep going&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Well, of course this is my personal interpretation and opinion, you
don&rsquo;t have to agree. But I would love to hear you: which is
your Enya top ten songs? And what you think about &ldquo;Anywhere Is&rdquo;? Email me: <a href="mailto:orangax@gmail.com&subject=Enya%20Lyrics%20-%20Top%20ten%20Enya%20songs">orangax@gmail.com</a>!</p>
<p>Next week, the number nine on my list; <a href="the-memory-of-trees.html"><em>The Memory Of Trees</em></a> instrumental title track. Thanks!</p>

<h4>Clannad touring the UK</h4>
<p><strong class="date">March 14 2008 &mdash;</strong> <a href="enya-clannad.html">Clannad</a>, the Irish band formed by many Enya relatives, it's in a comeback tour in the UK. It is 25 years since their "Theme From Harry�s Game" became a hit in Europe.</p>
<p>"It�s been a long time but I still crave the stage," says guitarist and vocalist Noel Duggan, now in his 60th year. His niece, the solo performer Enya, spent two years working with Clannad. "She was a very shy little girl. We don't see much of Enya at all now. She lives in a castle at Killiney, she lives like a queen. She doesn't go anywhere; she is a recluse."</p>
<p>The 2008 11-date UK tour will end at the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool on March 14.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/tm_headline=bono-no-longer-has-the-voice-for-clannad%26method=full%26objectid=20570945%26print_version=1%26siteid=91466-name_page.html" target="_blank">icWales</a>.</p>
